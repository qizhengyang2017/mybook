  {"id":"aguet2017","abstract":"Characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that underlie human genetic traits and diseases. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Aguet","given":"François"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Andrew A."},{"family":"Castel","given":"Stephane E."},{"family":"Davis","given":"Joe R."},{"family":"He","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Jo","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Mohammadi","given":"Pejman"},{"family":"Park","given":"YoSon"},{"family":"Parsana","given":"Princy"},{"family":"Segrè","given":"Ayellet V."},{"family":"Strober","given":"Benjamin J."},{"family":"Zappala","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Cummings","given":"Beryl B."},{"family":"Gelfand","given":"Ellen T."},{"family":"Hadley","given":"Kane"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Katherine H."},{"family":"Lek","given":"Monkol"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Nedzel","given":"Jared L."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Duyen Y."},{"family":"Noble","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Tukiainen","given":"Taru"},{"family":"MacArthur","given":"Daniel G."},{"family":"Getz","given":"Gad"},{"family":"Addington","given":"Anjene"},{"family":"Guan","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Koester","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Little","given":"A.

  {"id":"alonge2020","abstract":"Structural variants (SVs) underlie important crop improvement and domestication traits. However, resolving the extent, diversity, and quantitative impact of SVs has been challenging. We used long-read nanopore sequencing to capture 238,490 SVs in 100 diverse tomato lines. This panSV genome, along with 14 new reference assemblies, revealed large-scale intermixing of diverse genotypes, as well as thousands of SVs intersecting genes and cis-regulatory regions. Hundreds of SV-gene pairs exhibit subtle and significant expression changes, which could broadly influence quantitative trait variation. By combining quantitative genetics with genome editing, we show how multiple SVs that changed gene dosage and expression levels modified fruit flavor, size, and production. In the last example, higher order epistasis among four SVs affecting three related transcription factors allowed introduction of an important harvesting trait in modern tomato. Our findings highlight the underexplored role of SVs in genotype-to-phenotype relationships and their widespread importance and utility in crop improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Alonge","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xingang"},{"family":"Benoit","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Soyk","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Lara"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Suresh","given":"Hamsini"},{"family":"Ramakrishnan","given":"Srividya"},{"family":"Maumus","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Ciren","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Levy","given":"Yuval"},{"family":"Harel","given":"Tom Hai"},{"family":"Shalev-Schlosser","given":"Gili"},{"family":"Amsellem","given":"Ziva"},{"family":"Razifard","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Caicedo","given":"Ana L."},{"family":"Tieman","given":"Denise M."},{"family":"Klee","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Kirsche","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Aganezov","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Ranallo-Benavidez","given":"T.

  {"id":"he2021","abstract":"Large-scale genomic surveys of crop germplasm are important for understanding the genetic architecture of favorable traits. The genomic basis of geographic differentiation and fiber improvement in cultivated cotton is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed 3,248 tetraploid cotton genomes and confirmed that the extensive chromosome inversions on chromosomes A06 and A08 underlies the geographic differentiation in cultivated Gossypium hirsutum. We further revealed that the haplotypic diversity originated from landraces, which might be essential for understanding adaptative evolution in cultivated cotton. Introgression and association analyses identified new fiber quality-related loci and demonstrated that the introgressed alleles from two diploid cottons had a large effect on fiber quality improvement.

  {"id":"liu2019a","abstract":"Early genome-wide association studies (GWASs) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, most of the heritability is due to huge numbers of common variants with tiny effect sizes. Previously, we argued that new models are needed to understand these patterns. Here, we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits are partitioned into direct effects from core genes and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting in trans. We propose that most heritability is driven by weak trans-eQTL SNPs, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak trans effects. Thus, our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Xuanyao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yang I."},{"family":"Pritchard","given":"Jonathan K."}],"container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014","ISSN":"0092-8674","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1022-1034.e6","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Trans Effects on Gene Expression Can Drive Omnigenic Inheritance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419304003","volume":"177"},

The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations.

Our analyses of SV formation mechanisms, impacts on gene expression, and distributions among subpopulations illustrate the utility of these resources for understanding how SVs and gCNVs shaped rice environmental adaptation and domestication. Our graph-based genome enabled genome-wide association study (GWAS)-based identiﬁcation of phenotype-associated genetic variations undetectable when using only SNPs and a single reference assembly.

  {"id":"ruth2021","abstract":"Reproductive longevity is essential for fertility and influences healthy ageing in women1,2, but insights into its underlying biological mechanisms and treatments to preserve it are limited. Here we identify 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, assessed using normal variation in age at natural menopause (ANM) in about 200,000 women of European ancestry. These common alleles were associated with clinical extremes of ANM; women in the top 1% of genetic susceptibility have an equivalent risk of premature ovarian insufficiency to those carrying monogenic FMR1 premutations3. The identified loci implicate a broad range of DNA damage response (DDR) processes and include loss-of-function variants in key DDR-associated genes. Integration with experimental models demonstrates that these DDR processes act across the life-course to shape the ovarian reserve and its rate of depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental manipulation of DDR pathways highlighted by human genetics increases fertility and extends reproductive life in mice. Causal inference analyses using the identified genetic variants indicate that extending reproductive life in women improves bone health and reduces risk of type 2 diabetes, but increases the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms that govern ovarian ageing, when they act, and how they might be targeted by therapeutic approaches to extend fertility and prevent disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruth","given":"Katherine S."},{"family":"Day","given":"Felix R."},{"family":"Hussain","given":"Jazib"},{"family":"Martínez-Marchal","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Aiken","given":"Catherine E."},{"family":"Azad","given":"Ajuna"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Deborah J."},{"family":"Knoblochova","given":"Lucie"},{"family":"Abe","given":"Hironori"},{"family":"Tarry-Adkins","given":"Jane L."},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Javier Martin"},{"family":"Fontanillas","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Claringbould","given":"Annique"},{"family":"Bakker","given":"Olivier B."},{"family":"Sulem","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Walters","given":"Robin G."},{"family":"Terao","given":"Chikashi"},{"family":"Turon","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Horikoshi","given":"Momoko"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Kuang"},{"family":"Onland-Moret","given":"N.

  {"id":"silva2014","abstract":"MOTIVATION: The detection of genomic regions unusually rich in a given pattern is an important undertaking in the analysis of next-generation sequencing data. Recent studies of chromosomal translocations in activated B lymphocytes have identified regions that are frequently translocated to c-myc oncogene. A quantitative method for the identification of translocation hotspots was crucial to this study. Here we improve this analysis by using a simple probabilistic model and the framework provided by scan statistics to define the number and location of translocation breakpoint hotspots. A key feature of our method is that it provides a global chromosome-wide nominal control level to clustering, as opposed to previous methods based on local criteria. While being motivated by a specific application, the detection of unusual clusters is a widespread problem in bioinformatics. We expect our method to be useful in the analysis of data from other experimental approaches such as of ChIP-seq and 4C-seq.\nRESULTS: The analysis of translocations from B lymphocytes with the method described here reveals the presence of longer hotspots when compared with those defined previously. Further, we show that the hotspot size changes substantially in the absence of DNA repair protein 53BP1. When 53BP1 deficiency is combined with overexpression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, the hotspot length increases even further. These changes are not detected by previous methods that use local significance criteria for clustering. Our method is also able to identify several exclusive translocation hotspots located in genes of known tumor supressors.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The detection of translocation hotspots is done with hot_scan, a program implemented in R and Perl.

  {"id":"strober2019","abstract":"Variants affect gene expression over time\nGenetic variation drives the spectrum of human phenotypes but in some cases has been linked to pathological conditions. Strober et al. set out to explore how genetic diversity regulates gene expression in cell differentiation over time. They examined expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLS)—genetic variants correlated with gene expression—in induced pluripotent stem cell lines from 19 Yoruban individuals at 16 time points during differentiation into cardiomyocytes. They identified hundreds of developmental stage–specific eQTLs. Thus, the impact of genetic variations depends on the developmental context or tissue under observation.\nScience, this issue p. 1287\nGenetic regulation of gene expression is dynamic, as transcription can change during cell differentiation and across cell types. We mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) throughout differentiation to elucidate the dynamics of genetic effects on cell type–specific gene expression. We generated time-series RNA sequencing data, capturing 16 time points during the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes, in 19 human cell lines. We identified hundreds of dynamic eQTLs that change over time, with enrichment in enhancers of relevant cell types. We also found nonlinear dynamic eQTLs, which affect only intermediate stages of differentiation and cannot be found by using data from mature tissues. These fleeting genetic associations with gene regulation may explain some of the components of complex traits and disease. We highlight one example of a nonlinear eQTL that is associated with body mass index.\nGenetic variation affects temporal dynamics of gene expression in human cardiomyocyte differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells.\nGenetic variation affects temporal dynamics of gene expression in human cardiomyocyte differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Strober","given":"B.

  {"id":"urbut2019","abstract":"We introduce new statistical methods for analyzing genomic data sets that measure many effects in many conditions (for example, gene expression changes under many treatments). These new methods improve on existing methods by allowing for arbitrary correlations in effect sizes among conditions. This flexible approach increases power, improves effect estimates and allows for more quantitative assessments of effect-size heterogeneity compared to simple shared or condition-specific assessments. We illustrate these features through an analysis of locally acting variants associated with gene expression (cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) in 44 human tissues. Our analysis identifies more eQTLs than existing approaches, consistent with improved power. We show that although genetic effects on expression are extensively shared among tissues, effect sizes can still vary greatly among tissues. Some shared eQTLs show stronger effects in subsets of biologically related tissues (for example, brain-related tissues), or in only one tissue (for example, testis).

  {"id":"vosa2021a","abstract":"Trait-associated genetic variants affect complex phenotypes primarily via regulatory mechanisms on the transcriptome. To investigate the genetics of gene expression, we performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through the eQTLGen Consortium. We detected cis-eQTL for 88% of genes, and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-eQTL (detected for 37% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested) showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication power and confounding by cell type composition. However, replication analyses in single-cell RNA-seq data prioritized intracellular trans-eQTL. Trans-eQTL exerted their effects via several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by transcription factors. Expression of 13% of the genes correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes, pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this work represents a large eQTL resource, and its results serve as a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex phenotypes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Võsa","given":"Urmo"},{"family":"Claringbould","given":"Annique"},{"family":"Westra","given":"Harm-Jan"},{"family":"Bonder","given":"Marc Jan"},{"family":"Deelen","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Biao"},{"family":"Kirsten","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Saha","given":"Ashis"},{"family":"Kreuzhuber","given":"Roman"},{"family":"Yazar","given":"Seyhan"},{"family":"Brugge","given":"Harm"},{"family":"Oelen","given":"Roy"},{"family":"Vries","given":"Dylan H.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Wijst","given":"Monique G.

  {"id":"wallace2021a","abstract":"In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) it is now common to search for, and find, multiple causal variants located in close proximity. It has also become standard to ask whether different traits share the same causal variants, but one of the popular methods to answer this question, coloc, makes the simplifying assumption that only a single causal variant exists for any given trait in any genomic region. Here, we examine the potential of the recently proposed Sum of Single Effects (SuSiE) regression framework, which can be used for fine-mapping genetic signals, for use with coloc. SuSiE is a novel approach that allows evidence for association at multiple causal variants to be evaluated simultaneously, whilst separating the statistical support for each variant conditional on the causal signal being considered. We show this results in more accurate coloc inference than other proposals to adapt coloc for multiple causal variants based on conditioning. We therefore recommend that coloc be used in combination with SuSiE to optimise accuracy of colocalisation analyses when multiple causal variants exist.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wallace","given":"Chris"}],"container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1009440","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]]},"language":"en","page":"e1009440","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"A more accurate method for colocalisation analysis allowing for multiple causal variants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009440","volume":"17"},

Selection for alleles of genes associated with larger fruits altered metabolite proﬁles as a consequence of linkage with nearby genes. Selection of ﬁve major loci reduced the accumulation of anti-nutritional steroidal glycoalkaloids in ripened fruits, rendering the fruit more edible. Breeding for pink tomatoes modiﬁed the content of over 100 metabolites. The introgression of resistance genes from wild relatives in cultivars also resulted in major and unexpected metabolic changes.
