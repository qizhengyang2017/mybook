  {"id":"alonge2020","abstract":"Structural variants (SVs) underlie important crop improvement and domestication traits. However, resolving the extent, diversity, and quantitative impact of SVs has been challenging. We used long-read nanopore sequencing to capture 238,490 SVs in 100 diverse tomato lines. This panSV genome, along with 14 new reference assemblies, revealed large-scale intermixing of diverse genotypes, as well as thousands of SVs intersecting genes and cis-regulatory regions. Hundreds of SV-gene pairs exhibit subtle and significant expression changes, which could broadly influence quantitative trait variation. By combining quantitative genetics with genome editing, we show how multiple SVs that changed gene dosage and expression levels modified fruit flavor, size, and production. In the last example, higher order epistasis among four SVs affecting three related transcription factors allowed introduction of an important harvesting trait in modern tomato. Our findings highlight the underexplored role of SVs in genotype-to-phenotype relationships and their widespread importance and utility in crop improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Alonge","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xingang"},{"family":"Benoit","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Soyk","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Lara"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Suresh","given":"Hamsini"},{"family":"Ramakrishnan","given":"Srividya"},{"family":"Maumus","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Ciren","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Levy","given":"Yuval"},{"family":"Harel","given":"Tom Hai"},{"family":"Shalev-Schlosser","given":"Gili"},{"family":"Amsellem","given":"Ziva"},{"family":"Razifard","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Caicedo","given":"Ana L."},{"family":"Tieman","given":"Denise M."},{"family":"Klee","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Kirsche","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Aganezov","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Ranallo-Benavidez","given":"T.

  {"id":"he2021","abstract":"Large-scale genomic surveys of crop germplasm are important for understanding the genetic architecture of favorable traits. The genomic basis of geographic differentiation and fiber improvement in cultivated cotton is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed 3,248 tetraploid cotton genomes and confirmed that the extensive chromosome inversions on chromosomes A06 and A08 underlies the geographic differentiation in cultivated Gossypium hirsutum. We further revealed that the haplotypic diversity originated from landraces, which might be essential for understanding adaptative evolution in cultivated cotton. Introgression and association analyses identified new fiber quality-related loci and demonstrated that the introgressed alleles from two diploid cottons had a large effect on fiber quality improvement. These loci provided the potential power to overcome the bottleneck in fiber quality improvement. Our study uncovered several critical genomic signatures generated by historical breeding effects in cotton and a wealth of data that enrich genomic resources for the research community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Shoupu"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Gaofei"},{"family":"Geng","given":"Xiaoli"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Wenfang"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Panhong"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Yinhua"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Weijun"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Zhaoe"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Junduo"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Liyuan"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Songhua"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Baojun"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Shufang"},{"family":"You","given":"Chunyuan"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Zongming"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Guoyong"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Daowu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Liru"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Baoyin"},{"family":"Du","given":"Xiongming"}],"container-title":"Nature Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00844-9","ISSN":"1546-1718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,15]]},"language":"en","page":"1-9","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The genomic basis of geographic differentiation and fiber improvement in cultivated cotton","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00844-9"},
