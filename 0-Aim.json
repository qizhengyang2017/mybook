  {"id":"he2021","abstract":"Large-scale genomic surveys of crop germplasm are important for understanding the genetic architecture of favorable traits. The genomic basis of geographic differentiation and fiber improvement in cultivated cotton is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed 3,248 tetraploid cotton genomes and confirmed that the extensive chromosome inversions on chromosomes A06 and A08 underlies the geographic differentiation in cultivated Gossypium hirsutum. We further revealed that the haplotypic diversity originated from landraces, which might be essential for understanding adaptative evolution in cultivated cotton. Introgression and association analyses identified new fiber quality-related loci and demonstrated that the introgressed alleles from two diploid cottons had a large effect on fiber quality improvement. These loci provided the potential power to overcome the bottleneck in fiber quality improvement. Our study uncovered several critical genomic signatures generated by historical breeding effects in cotton and a wealth of data that enrich genomic resources for the research community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Shoupu"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Gaofei"},{"family":"Geng","given":"Xiaoli"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Wenfang"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Panhong"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Yinhua"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Weijun"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Zhaoe"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Junduo"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Liyuan"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Songhua"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Baojun"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Shufang"},{"family":"You","given":"Chunyuan"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Zongming"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Guoyong"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Daowu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Liru"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Baoyin"},{"family":"Du","given":"Xiongming"}],"container-title":"Nature Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00844-9","ISSN":"1546-1718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,15]]},"language":"en","page":"1-9","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The genomic basis of geographic differentiation and fiber improvement in cultivated cotton","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00844-9"},

Cis-eQTL analysis identified 10,474 genes under genetic regulation, including 4,541 eQTLs detected only in the retina. Integrated analysis of AMD-GWAS with eQTLs ascertained likely target genes at six reported loci. Using transcriptome-wide association analysis (TWAS), we identified three additional genes, RLBP1, HIC1 and PARP12, after Bonferroni correction. Our studies expand the genetic landscape of AMD and establish the Eye Genotype Expression (EyeGEx) database as a resource for post-GWAS interpretation of multifactorial ocular traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ratnapriya","given":"Rinki"},{"family":"Sosina","given":"Olukayode A."},{"family":"Starostik","given":"Margaret R."},{"family":"Kwicklis","given":"Madeline"},{"family":"Kapphahn","given":"Rebecca J."},{"family":"Fritsche","given":"Lars G."},{"family":"Walton","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Arvanitis","given":"Marios"},{"family":"Gieser","given":"Linn"},{"family":"Pietraszkiewicz","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Montezuma","given":"Sandra R."},{"family":"Chew","given":"Emily Y."},{"family":"Battle","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Abecasis","given":"Gonçalo R."},{"family":"Ferrington","given":"Deborah A."},{"family":"Chatterjee","given":"Nilanjan"},{"family":"Swaroop","given":"Anand"}],"container-title":"Nature Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-019-0351-9","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4]]},"language":"en","number":"4","page":"606-610","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Retinal transcriptome and eQTL analyses identify genes associated with age-related macular degeneration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0351-9","volume":"51"},
  {"id":"zhang2021c","abstract":"Tea is an important global beverage crop and is largely clonally propagated. Despite previous studies on the species, its genetic and evolutionary history deserves further research. Here, we present a haplotype-resolved assembly of an Oolong tea cultivar, Tieguanyin. Analysis of allele-specific expression suggests a potential mechanism in response to mutation load during long-term clonal propagation. Population genomic analysis using 190 Camellia accessions uncovered independent evolutionary histories and parallel domestication in two widely cultivated varieties, var. sinensis and var. assamica. It also revealed extensive intra- and interspecific introgressions contributing to genetic diversity in modern cultivars. Strong signatures of selection were associated with biosynthetic and metabolic pathways that contribute to flavor characteristics as well as genes likely involved in the Green Revolution in the tea industry. Our results offer genetic and molecular insights into the evolutionary history of Camellia sinensis and provide genomic resources to further facilitate gene editing to enhance desirable traits in tea crops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xingtan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Longqing"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Daping"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shengcheng"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Dongliang"},{"family":"Vasseur","given":"Liette"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yibin"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Jiaxin"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Zhenyang"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Xindan"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wenling"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yunran"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Pengjie"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Naixing"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Dongna"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Haifeng"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Xiaokai"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Xiangrui"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Liufeng"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yaying"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ruoyu"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Guiping"},{"family":"He","given":"Haifang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Ming","given":"Ray"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Gang"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Haibao"},{"family":"You","given":"Minsheng"}],"container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00895-y","ISSN":"1546-1718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,15]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Genomics;Plant genetics;Population genetics\nSubject_term_id: genomics;plant-genetics;population-genetics","page":"1-10","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Haplotype-resolved genome assembly provides insights into evolutionary history of the tea plant Camellia sinensis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00895-y"}
