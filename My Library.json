  {"id":"2020","abstract":"现在使用 MathJaX 直接在浏览器里显示数学公式已经非常方便了，基本上只要在 HTML header 里插入两句引用一下 MathJaX 的 CDN，然后在页面里的 LaTeX 公式就会被自动转化为数学公式显示。运作方式是 MathJaX 作为 Javascript 在客户端浏览器里运行，寻找 HTML 文档里的 LaTeX 表达式，然后将其转化为公式（通过 HTML 或者 SVG 排版的方式）显示出来。不过客户端渲染有一些小问题就是每次用户打开都要重新渲染，取决于用户的网速、系统运行 JS 的速度等等，可能渲染速度会不太一样，而且后期渲染会导致 HTML 文档布局变化等等。所以有时候考虑在 server 端预渲染是一个不错的选择。 在 MathJaX 出现之前一般 server 端的渲染是基于真实的 LaTeX 的，就是直接运行 LaTeX 编译出 dvi 文件，然后用 dvipng 之类的工具转化为图片格式，插入到 HTML 文档中。这种方式的好处是和 LaTeX 完全兼容，坏处一个是需要运行 shell 去调用 LaTeX，如果是用户输入的文本的话可能有一定安全隐患，而且对 server 负担可能也有点大，当然最重要的还是 png 这类的图片格式显示的公式特别是在 inline 的时候不能很好地和周围的文本对齐，经常会很难看。 另一个就是把 MathJaX 在 server 端预先渲染成 SVG 格式。实际上我这个博客里之前的公式一直是这样显示的，这样可以整个页面静态加载，即使客户端禁用了 Javascript 也能显示，再复杂一些也许可以做到在支持 SVG 的 RSS Reader 里也能直接显示公式。我使用的是一个叫做 svgtex 的工具。它的运行方式是通过 PhantomJS 在 server 端跑起 MathJaX 来，然后在一个端口监听，你可以通过发送 HTTP 请求到该端口，输入 LaTeX 的公式，它就会调用 MathJaX 进行渲染，然后把渲染的结果（SVG 格式）发送回来。由于我的博客是编译成静态页面的，所以我直接做了一个简单的后期处理，拿到 SVG 之后替换掉 LaTeX 公式文本内嵌到 HTML 中即可（因为 SVG 其实是文本格式），我用类似于下面这一段代码来做后期处理： require 'uri'require 'net/http'def tex2svg_impl(math, display=false) # undo some preprocessing done by pandoc require 'cgi' math = CGI.unescapeHTML(math) uri = URI.parse('http://localhost:16000') http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port) request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.request_uri) if display request.body = '\\displaystyle{' + math + '}' else request.body = math end http.request(request).bodyenddesc \"convert MathJaX formula to embeded SVG\"task :tex2svg do require 'find' # currently do not support rss.xml, because # 1. pandoc do HTML escape, which is escaped again in XML, making # it difficult to unescape # 2. the SVG image is displayed as crazily full page-width images # in Firefox RSS view Find.find('compiled-production') do |path| if path.match(/html\\Z/) puts path content = File.read(path) content.gsub! /<span class=\"math[^\"]*\">(.*?)<\\/span>/m do |match| # strip \\( \\) or \\[ \\] math = $1[2..-3] if $1[1] == '(' '<span style=\"font-size:100%; display:inline-block;\">' + tex2svg_impl(math) + '</span>' else '<span class=\"svg-math-block\">' + tex2svg_impl(math, true) + '</span>' end end File.open(path, 'w') do |f| f.write(content) end end endend 不过我的 Blog 代码也是很多年前写的了，最近换新电脑的时候做系统迁移才发现原来 PhantomJS 都已经停止开发了，然后 svgtex 也已经 depreciated 了……不过 svgtex 有一个后继者叫做 mathoid，看了一下现在已经是 Wikimedia 的项目了，看来 Wikipedia 现在已经是用这个在做 server 端渲染了，居然一直都没有注意到。 这个 mathoid 最开始是从 svgtex fork 出来的，使用方法基本差不多，不过不再依赖于 PhantomJS，而是基于 node.js。但是我对 node.js 并不是很熟悉，感觉 setup 又会有多一套系统需要维护，由于我现在写 blog 的频率并不高，生成博客的代码维护则更是几乎没有在跟进，这次在修理 Rack 更新之后出现的问题花了很久，发现我都几乎不太会写 Ruby 代码了，越发意识到这种没有积极维护的系统还是依赖越少，功能越简单越好，而且 server side 渲染对我来说其实并不是一定要有的功能，所以最后干脆又切换回了直接使用 MathJaX 的 CDN 在客户端渲染的方式。 不过换回去之前想把这个解决方案在这里分享一下，有可能以后会有用，而且之前也有人问过我 blog 里的公式是怎么显示的，因为右键并不会弹出 MathJaX 的菜单哈哈。不过这里还值得一提的是一个后来出现的叫做 KaTeX 的 MathJaX 的竞争者，它是直接支持 server 端渲染的，如果你有一个 server 端 javascript 系统（比如 node.js），可以直接这样渲染： var html = katex.renderToString(\"c = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\", { throwOnError: false }); // '<span class=\"katex\">...</span>' 当然 KaTeX 和 MathJaX 相比各有优缺点，KaTeX 的优势是速度比 MathJaX 快很多（虽然 MathJaX 对于普通使用来说已经不慢了），不过相比就是支持的 TeX 命令可能没有后者那么全，虽然这些年来已经改进了很多了，不过似乎有些复杂的公式显示还是和 MathJaX 渲染的结果有一些差距。网上有一些比较详细的比较，比如 这个页面，具体用哪个还是看自己的需求啦。","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,9]]},"title":"Server Side Math Rendering","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://freemind.pluskid.org/technology/server-side-math-rendering"},

Here, a best-fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared  distance from the points to the line. These directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated. Principal component analysis (PCA) is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest.\nPCA is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          i\n          \n            th\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i^{\\text{th}}}\n   principal component can be taken as a direction orthogonal to the first \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        −\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i-1}\n   principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data. \nFrom either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. Thus, the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix. PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix. PCA is also related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in a single dataset. Robust and L1-norm-based variants of standard PCA have also been proposed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,27]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,16]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 994616921","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Principal component analysis","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Principal_component_analysis&oldid=994616921"},

  {"id":"2021","abstract":"Genetic linkage is the tendency of DNA sequences that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together during the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction. Two genetic markers that are physically near to each other are unlikely to be separated onto different chromatids during chromosomal crossover, and are therefore said to be more linked than markers that are far apart. In other words, the nearer two genes are on a chromosome, the lower the chance of recombination between them, and the more likely they are to be inherited together. Markers on different chromosomes are perfectly unlinked.\nGenetic linkage is the most prominent exception to Gregor Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment. The first experiment to demonstrate linkage was carried out in 1905. At the time, the reason why certain traits tend to be inherited together was unknown. Later work revealed that genes are physical structures related by physical distance.\nThe typical unit of genetic linkage is the centimorgan (cM). A distance of 1 cM between two markers means that the markers are separated to different chromosomes on average once per 100 meiotic product, thus once per 50 meioses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,28]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,6]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 998658952","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Genetic linkage","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genetic_linkage&oldid=998658952"},

  {"id":"2021p","abstract":"Locus heterogeneity occurs when mutations at multiple genomic loci are capable of producing the same phenotype (ie. a single trait, pattern of traits, or disorder), and each individual mutation is sufficient to cause the specific phenotype independently. Locus heterogeneity should not be confused with allelic heterogeneity, in which a single phenotype can be produced by multiple mutations, all of which are at the same locus on a chromosome. Likewise, it should not be confused with phenotypic heterogeneity, in which different phenotypes arise among organisms with identical genotypes and environmental conditions. Locus heterogeneity and allelic heterogeneity are the two components of genetic heterogeneity.Locus heterogeneity may have major implications for a number of human diseases. For instance, it has been associated with retinitis pigmentosa, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, osteogenesis imperfecta, and familial hypercholesterolemia.  Heterogenous loci involved in formation of the same phenotype often contribute to similar biological pathways. The role and degree of locus heterogeneity is an important consideration in understanding disease phenotypes and in the development of therapeutic treatment for these diseases.The detection of causal genes for diseases impacted by locus heterogeneity is difficult with genetic analysis methods such as linkage analysis and genome sequencing. These methods rely on comparison of affected family members, but when different family members have different disease-causing genes, such genes may not be accurately identified. Existing techniques have been modified and new techniques have been developed to overcome these challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,1]]},"container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,8]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1043135678","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Locus heterogeneity","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Locus_heterogeneity&oldid=1043135678"},

  {"id":"ackermann2013","abstract":"DNA sequence variation causes changes in gene expression, which in turn has profound effects on cellular states. These variations affect tissue development and may ultimately lead to pathological phenotypes. A genetic locus containing a sequence variation that affects gene expression is called an “expression quantitative trait locus” (eQTL). Whereas the impact of cellular context on expression levels in general is well established, a lot less is known about the cell-state specificity of eQTL. Previous studies differed with respect to how “dynamic eQTL” were defined. Here, we propose a unified framework distinguishing static, conditional and dynamic eQTL and suggest strategies for mapping these eQTL classes. Further, we introduce a new approach to simultaneously infer eQTL from different cell types. By using murine mRNA expression data from four stages of hematopoiesis and 14 related cellular traits, we demonstrate that static, conditional and dynamic eQTL, although derived from the same expression data, represent functionally distinct types of eQTL. While static eQTL affect generic cellular processes, non-static eQTL are more often involved in hematopoiesis and immune response. Our analysis revealed substantial effects of individual genetic variation on cell type-specific expression regulation. Among a total number of 3,941 eQTL we detected 2,729 static eQTL, 1,187 eQTL were conditionally active in one or several cell types, and 70 eQTL affected expression changes during cell type transitions. We also found evidence for feedback control mechanisms reverting the effect of an eQTL specifically in certain cell types. Loci correlated with hematological traits were enriched for conditional eQTL, thus, demonstrating the importance of conditional eQTL for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying physiological trait variation. The classification proposed here has the potential to streamline and unify future analysis of conditional and dynamic eQTL as well as many other kinds of QTL data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Ackermann","given":"Marit"},{"family":"Sikora-Wohlfeld","given":"Weronika"},{"family":"Beyer","given":"Andreas"}],"container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1003514","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,6]]},"language":"en","page":"e1003514","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Impact of Natural Genetic Variation on Gene Expression Dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003514","volume":"9"},

We investigated whether people are as likely to consider changes that subtract components from an object, idea or situation as they are to consider changes that add new components. People typically consider a limited number of promising ideas in order to manage the cognitive burden of searching through all possible ideas, but this can lead them to accept adequate solutions without considering potentially superior alternatives4–10. Here we show that people systematically default to searching for additive transformations, and consequently overlook subtractive transformations. Across eight experiments, participants were less likely to identify advantageous subtractive changes when the task did not (versus did) cue them to consider subtraction, when they had only one opportunity (versus several) to recognize the shortcomings of an additive search strategy or when they were under a higher (versus lower) cognitive load. Defaulting to searches for additive changes may be one reason that people struggle to mitigate overburdened schedules11, institutional red tape12 and damaging effects on the planet13,14.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Adams","given":"Gabrielle S."},{"family":"Converse","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Hales","given":"Andrew H."},{"family":"Klotz","given":"Leidy E."}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03380-y","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7853","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4]]},"language":"en","number":"7853","page":"258-261","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"People systematically overlook subtractive changes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03380-y","volume":"592"},
  {"id":"agoglia2021","abstract":"Among primates, humans display a unique trajectory of development that is responsible for the many traits specific to our species. However, the inaccessibility of primary human and chimpanzee tissues has limited our ability to study human evolution. Comparative in vitro approaches using primate-derived induced pluripotent stem cells have begun to reveal species differences on the cellular and molecular levels1,2. In particular, brain organoids have emerged as a promising platform to study primate neural development in vitro3–5, although cross-species comparisons of organoids are complicated by differences in developmental timing and variability of differentiation6,7. Here we develop a new platform to address these limitations by fusing human and chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cells to generate a panel of tetraploid hybrid stem cells. We applied this approach to study species divergence in cerebral cortical development by differentiating these cells into neural organoids. We found that hybrid organoids provide a controlled system for disentangling cis- and trans-acting gene-expression divergence across cell types and developmental stages, revealing a signature of selection on astrocyte-related genes. In addition, we identified an upregulation of the human somatostatin receptor 2 gene (SSTR2), which regulates neuronal calcium signalling and is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders8,9. We reveal a human-specific response to modulation of SSTR2 function in cortical neurons, underscoring the potential of this platform for elucidating the molecular basis of human evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Agoglia","given":"Rachel M."},{"family":"Sun","given":"Danqiong"},{"family":"Birey","given":"Fikri"},{"family":"Yoon","given":"Se-Jin"},{"family":"Miura","given":"Yuki"},{"family":"Sabatini","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Pașca","given":"Sergiu P."},{"family":"Fraser","given":"Hunter B."}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03343-3","ISSN":"1476-4687","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"language":"en","page":"1-7","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Primate cell fusion disentangles gene regulatory divergence in neurodevelopment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03343-3"},

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Aguet","given":"François"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Andrew A."},{"family":"Castel","given":"Stephane E."},{"family":"Davis","given":"Joe R."},{"family":"He","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Jo","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Mohammadi","given":"Pejman"},{"family":"Park","given":"YoSon"},{"family":"Parsana","given":"Princy"},{"family":"Segrè","given":"Ayellet V."},{"family":"Strober","given":"Benjamin J."},{"family":"Zappala","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Cummings","given":"Beryl B."},{"family":"Gelfand","given":"Ellen T."},{"family":"Hadley","given":"Kane"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Katherine H."},{"family":"Lek","given":"Monkol"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Nedzel","given":"Jared L."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Duyen Y."},{"family":"Noble","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Tukiainen","given":"Taru"},{"family":"MacArthur","given":"Daniel G."},{"family":"Getz","given":"Gad"},{"family":"Addington","given":"Anjene"},{"family":"Guan","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Koester","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Little","given":"A.

Despite rapid advances over recent years, many of the molecular and cellular processes that underlie the progressive loss of healthy physiology are poorly understood2. To gain a better insight into these processes, here we generate a single-cell transcriptomic atlas across the lifespan of Mus musculus that includes data from 23 tissues and organs. We found cell-specific changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age-related changes in the cellular composition of different organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data, we assessed cell-type-specific manifestations of different hallmarks of ageing—such as senescence3, genomic instability4 and changes in the immune system2. This transcriptomic atlas—which we denote Tabula Muris Senis, or ‘Mouse Ageing Cell Atlas’—provides molecular information about how the most important hallmarks of ageing are reflected in a broad range of tissues and cell types.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Almanzar","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Antony","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Baghel","given":"Ankit S."},{"family":"Bakerman","given":"Isaac"},{"family":"Bansal","given":"Ishita"},{"family":"Barres","given":"Ben A."},{"family":"Beachy","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Berdnik","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Bilen","given":"Biter"},{"family":"Brownfield","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Cain","given":"Corey"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Charles K.

However, resolving the extent, diversity, and quantitative impact of SVs has been challenging. We used long-read nanopore sequencing to capture 238,490 SVs in 100 diverse tomato lines. This panSV genome, along with 14 new reference assemblies, revealed large-scale intermixing of diverse genotypes, as well as thousands of SVs intersecting genes and cis-regulatory regions. Hundreds of SV-gene pairs exhibit subtle and significant expression changes, which could broadly influence quantitative trait variation. By combining quantitative genetics with genome editing, we show how multiple SVs that changed gene dosage and expression levels modified fruit flavor, size, and production. In the last example, higher order epistasis among four SVs affecting three related transcription factors allowed introduction of an important harvesting trait in modern tomato. Our findings highlight the underexplored role of SVs in genotype-to-phenotype relationships and their widespread importance and utility in crop improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Alonge","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xingang"},{"family":"Benoit","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Soyk","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Lara"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Suresh","given":"Hamsini"},{"family":"Ramakrishnan","given":"Srividya"},{"family":"Maumus","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Ciren","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Levy","given":"Yuval"},{"family":"Harel","given":"Tom Hai"},{"family":"Shalev-Schlosser","given":"Gili"},{"family":"Amsellem","given":"Ziva"},{"family":"Razifard","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Caicedo","given":"Ana L."},{"family":"Tieman","given":"Denise M."},{"family":"Klee","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Kirsche","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Aganezov","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Ranallo-Benavidez","given":"T.

These data document the generality of recombination hotspots, a block-like structure of linkage disequilibrium and low haplotype diversity, leading to substantial correlations of SNPs with many of their neighbours.

  {"id":"andersson2020","abstract":"The proper activities of enhancers and gene promoters are essential for coordinated transcription within a cell. Although diverse methodologies have been developed to identify enhancers and promoters, most have tacitly assumed that these elements are distinct. However, studies have unexpectedly shown that regulatory elements may have both enhancer and promoter functions. Here we review these results, focusing on the factors that determine the promoter and/or enhancer activity of regulatory elements. We discuss emerging models that define regulatory elements by accessible DNA and their non-mutually-exclusive abilities to drive transcription initiation (promoter activity) and/or to enhance transcription at other such regions (enhancer activity). Activating transcriptional regulatory elements have traditionally been categorized into promoters, which define transcription start sites, and enhancers, which act distally to stimulate transcription. In this Review, Andersson and Sandelin discuss the latest findings from methodologies for profiling and testing transcriptional regulatory elements at scale. They explain how the data support an updated, nuanced model that accounts for the numerous overlapping molecular properties of promoters and enhancers.","author":[{"family":"Andersson","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Sandelin","given":"Albin"}],"container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"anzalone2019","abstract":"Most genetic variants that contribute to disease1 are challenging to correct efficiently and without excess byproducts2–5. Here we describe prime editing, a versatile and precise genome editing method that directly writes new genetic information into a specified DNA site using a catalytically impaired Cas9 endonuclease fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase, programmed with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) that both specifies the target site and encodes the desired edit. We performed more than 175 edits in human cells, including targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 types of point mutation, without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. We used prime editing in human cells to correct, efficiently and with few byproducts, the primary genetic causes of sickle cell disease (requiring a transversion in HBB) and Tay–Sachs disease (requiring a deletion in HEXA); to install a protective transversion in PRNP; and to insert various tags and epitopes precisely into target loci. Four human cell lines and primary post-mitotic mouse cortical neurons support prime editing with varying efficiencies. Prime editing shows higher or similar efficiency and fewer byproducts than homology-directed repair, has complementary strengths and weaknesses compared to base editing, and induces much lower off-target editing than Cas9 nuclease at known Cas9 off-target sites. Prime editing substantially expands the scope and capabilities of genome editing, and in principle could correct up to 89% of known genetic variants associated with human diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Anzalone","given":"Andrew V."},{"family":"Randolph","given":"Peyton B."},{"family":"Davis","given":"Jessie R."},{"family":"Sousa","given":"Alexander A."},{"family":"Koblan","given":"Luke W."},{"family":"Levy","given":"Jonathan M."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Newby","given":"Gregory A."},{"family":"Raguram","given":"Aditya"},{"family":"Liu","given":"David R."}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-019-1711-4","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7785","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Genetic engineering;Targeted gene repair\nSubject_term_id: genetic-engineering;targeted-gene-repair","number":"7785","page":"149-157","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Search-and-replace genome editing without double-strand breaks or donor DNA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1711-4","volume":"576"},

Here, we compare the fiber transcriptomes between wild and domesticated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and their reciprocal F1 hybrids, revealing genome-wide (~15%) and often compensatory cis and trans regulatory changes under divergence and domestication. The high level of trans evolution (54%–64%) observed is likely enabled by genomic redundancy following polyploidy. Our results reveal that regulatory variation is significantly associated with sequence evolution, inheritance of parental expression patterns, co-expression gene network properties, and genomic loci responsible for domestication traits. With respect to regulatory evolution, the two subgenomes of allotetraploid cotton are often uncoupled. Overall, our work underscores the complexity of regulatory evolution during fiber domestication and may facilitate new approaches for improving cotton and other polyploid plants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Bao","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Guanjing"},{"family":"Grover","given":"Corrinne E."},{"family":"Conover","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Daojun"},{"family":"Wendel","given":"Jonathan F."}],"container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-019-13386-w","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,27]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"5399","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Unraveling cis and trans regulatory evolution during cotton domestication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13386-w","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"boyle2017","abstract":"A central goal of genetics is to understand the links between genetic variation and disease. Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome—including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an “omnigenic” model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Boyle","given":"Evan A."},{"family":"Li","given":"Yang I."},{"family":"Pritchard","given":"Jonathan K."}],"container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038","ISSN":"0092-8674","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,15]]},"language":"en","page":"1177-1186","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"An Expanded View of Complex Traits: From Polygenic to Omnigenic","title-short":"An Expanded View of Complex Traits","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867417306293","volume":"169"},
  {"id":"bravi2020","abstract":"In allosteric proteins, the binding of a ligand modifies function at a distant active site. Such allosteric pathways can be used as target for drug design, generating considerable interest in inferring them from sequence alignment data. Currently, different methods lead to conflicting results, in particular on the existence of long-range evolutionary couplings between distant amino-acids mediating allostery. Here we propose a resolution of this conundrum, by studying epistasis and its inference in models where an allosteric material is evolved in silico to perform a mechanical task. We find in our model the four types of epistasis (Synergistic, Sign, Antagonistic, Saturation), which can be both short or long-range and have a simple mechanical interpretation. We perform a Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) and find that DCA predicts well the cost of point mutations but is a rather poor generative model. Strikingly, it can predict short-range epistasis but fails to capture long-range epistasis, in consistence with empirical findings. We propose that such failure is generic when function requires subparts to work in concert. We illustrate this idea with a simple model, which suggests that other methods may be better suited to capture long-range effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bravi","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Ravasio","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Brito","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Wyart","given":"Matthieu"}],"container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007630","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,2]]},"language":"en","page":"e1007630","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Direct coupling analysis of epistasis in allosteric materials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007630","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"brown2013","abstract":"Genetic variants in cis-regulatory elements or trans-acting regulators frequently influence the quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of gene transcription. Recent interest in expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping has paralleled the adoption of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the analysis of complex traits and disease in humans. Under the hypothesis that many GWAS associations tag non-coding SNPs with small effects, and that these SNPs exert phenotypic control by modifying gene expression, it has become common to interpret GWAS associations using eQTL data. To fully exploit the mechanistic interpretability of eQTL-GWAS comparisons, an improved understanding of the genetic architecture and causal mechanisms of cell type specificity of eQTLs is required. We address this need by performing an eQTL analysis in three parts: first we identified eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types; then we integrated eQTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project; finally we built a set of classifiers to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs. The cell type specificity of eQTLs is associated with eQTL SNP overlap with hundreds of cell type specific CRE classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and many classes of DNA binding proteins. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating the cell type specificity of eQTLs and the mode of regulation of corresponding eQTLs. Using a random forest classifier with cell specific CRE-SNP overlap as features, we demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs. We then demonstrate that CREs from a trait-associated cell type can be used to annotate GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. We anticipate that such integrative, predictive modeling of cell specificity will improve our ability to understand the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Christopher D."},{"family":"Mangravite","given":"Lara M."},{"family":"Engelhardt","given":"Barbara E."}],"container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1003649","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e1003649","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Integrative Modeling of eQTLs and Cis-Regulatory Elements Suggests Mechanisms Underlying Cell Type Specificity of eQTLs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003649","volume":"9"},

We dissected variation for flowering time with a set of 5000 recombinant inbred lines (maize Nested Association Mapping population, NAM). Nearly a million plants were assayed in eight environments but showed no evidence for any single large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Instead, we identified evidence for numerous small-effect QTLs shared among families; however, allelic effects differ across founder lines. We identified no individual QTLs at which allelic effects are determined by geographic origin or large effects for epistasis or environmental interactions. Thus, a simple additive model accurately predicts flowering time for maize, in contrast to the genetic architecture observed in the selfing plant species rice and Arabidopsis.","author":[{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."},{"family":"Holland","given":"James B."},{"family":"Bradbury","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Acharya","given":"Charlotte B."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Browne","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Ersoz","given":"Elhan"},{"family":"Flint-Garcia","given":"Sherry"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Arturo"},{"family":"Glaubitz","given":"Jeffrey C."},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Major M."},{"family":"Harjes","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Guill","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Kroon","given":"Dallas E."},{"family":"Larsson","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Lepak","given":"Nicholas K."},{"family":"Li","given":"Huihui"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Sharon E."},{"family":"Pressoir","given":"Gael"},{"family":"Peiffer","given":"Jason A."},{"family":"Rosas","given":"Marco Oropeza"},{"family":"Rocheford","given":"Torbert R."},{"family":"Romay","given":"M.

Single-cell transcriptomics have revealed global T cell dysfunction programs in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). However, the majority of TIL do not recognize tumour antigens\n              2\n              , and little is known about transcriptional programs of MANA-specific TIL. Here, we identify MANA-specific T cell clones using the MANA functional expansion of specific T cells assay\n              3\n              in neoadjuvant anti-PD-1-treated non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). We use their T cell receptors as a ‘barcode’ to track and analyse their transcriptional programs in the tumour microenvironment using coupled single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor sequencing. We find both MANA- and virus-specific clones in TIL, regardless of response, and MANA-, influenza- and Epstein–Barr virus-specific TIL each have unique transcriptional programs. Despite exposure to cognate antigen, MANA-specific TIL express an incompletely activated cytolytic program. MANA-specific CD8 T cells have hallmark transcriptional programs of tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, but low levels of interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and are functionally less responsive to interleukin-7 (IL-7) compared with influenza-specific TRM cells. Compared with those from responding tumours, MANA-specific clones from non-responding tumours express T cell receptors with markedly lower ligand-dependent signalling, are largely confined to HOBIT\n              high\n              TRM subsets, and coordinately upregulate checkpoints, killer inhibitory receptors and inhibitors of T cell activation. These findings provide important insights for overcoming resistance to PD-1 blockade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Caushi","given":"Justina X."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jiajia"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Zhicheng"},{"family":"Vaghasia","given":"Ajay"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Boyang"},{"family":"Hsiue","given":"Emily Han-Chung"},{"family":"Mog","given":"Brian J."},{"family":"Hou","given":"Wenpin"},{"family":"Justesen","given":"Sune"},{"family":"Blosser","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Tam","given":"Ada"},{"family":"Anagnostou","given":"Valsamo"},{"family":"Cottrell","given":"Tricia R."},{"family":"Guo","given":"Haidan"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Hok Yee"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Dipika"},{"family":"Thapa","given":"Sampriti"},{"family":"Dykema","given":"Arbor G."},{"family":"Burman","given":"Poromendro"},{"family":"Choudhury","given":"Begum"},{"family":"Aparicio","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Cheung","given":"Laurene S."},{"family":"Lanis","given":"Mara"},{"family":"Belcaid","given":"Zineb"},{"family":"El Asmar","given":"Margueritta"},{"family":"Illei","given":"Peter B."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Rulin"},{"family":"Meyers","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Schuebel","given":"Kornel"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Anuj"},{"family":"Skaist","given":"Alyza"},{"family":"Wheelan","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Naidoo","given":"Jarushka"},{"family":"Marrone","given":"Kristen A."},{"family":"Brock","given":"Malcolm"},{"family":"Ha","given":"Jinny"},{"family":"Bush","given":"Errol L."},{"family":"Park","given":"Bernard J."},{"family":"Bott","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Jones","given":"David R."},{"family":"Reuss","given":"Joshua E."},{"family":"Velculescu","given":"Victor E."},{"family":"Chaft","given":"Jamie E."},{"family":"Kinzler","given":"Kenneth W."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Shibin"},{"family":"Vogelstein","given":"Bert"},{"family":"Taube","given":"Janis M."},{"family":"Hellmann","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Brahmer","given":"Julie R."},{"family":"Merghoub","given":"Taha"},{"family":"Forde","given":"Patrick M."},{"family":"Yegnasubramanian","given":"Srinivasan"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Hongkai"},{"family":"Pardoll","given":"Drew M."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Kellie N."}],"container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03752-4","ISSN":"0028-0836, 1476-4687","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,21]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transcriptional programs of neoantigen-specific TIL in anti-PD-1-treated lung cancers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03752-4"},

  {"id":"chen2016","abstract":"Motivation: Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only ∼1000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear regression (LR), limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expressions of genes.Results: We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms LR with 15.33\n% relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than LR in 99.97\n% of the target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2921 expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms LR with 6.57\n% relative improvement, and achieves lower error in 81.31\n% of the target genes.Availability and implementation: D-GEX is available at https://github.com/uci-cbcl/D-GEX.Contact:xhx@ics.uci.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yifei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Narayan","given":"Rajiv"},{"family":"Subramanian","given":"Aravind"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Xiaohui"}],"container-title":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btw074","ISSN":"1367-4803","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2]]},"page":"1832-1839","title":"Gene expression inference with deep learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw074","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"chen2020","abstract":"Polyploidy is an evolutionary innovation for many animals and all flowering plants, but its impact on selection and domestication remains elusive. Here we analyze genome evolution and diversification for all five allopolyploid cotton species, including economically important Upland and Pima cottons. Although these polyploid genomes are conserved in gene content and synteny, they have diversified by subgenomic transposon exchanges that equilibrate genome size, evolutionary rate heterogeneities and positive selection between homoeologs within and among lineages. These differential evolutionary trajectories are accompanied by gene-family diversification and homoeolog expression divergence among polyploid lineages. Selection and domestication drive parallel gene expression similarities in fibers of two cultivated cottons, involving coexpression networks and N6-methyladenosine RNA modifications. Furthermore, polyploidy induces recombination suppression, which correlates with altered epigenetic landscapes and can be overcome by wild introgression. These genomic insights will empower efforts to manipulate genetic recombination and modify epigenetic landscapes and target genes for crop improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Z.

However, existing algorithms either collapse heterozygous alleles into one consensus copy or fail to cleanly separate the haplotypes to produce high-quality phased assemblies. Here we describe hifiasm, a de novo assembler that takes advantage of long high-fidelity sequence reads to faithfully represent the haplotype information in a phased assembly graph. Unlike other graph-based assemblers that only aim to maintain the contiguity of one haplotype, hifiasm strives to preserve the contiguity of all haplotypes. This feature enables the development of a graph trio binning algorithm that greatly advances over standard trio binning. On three human and five nonhuman datasets, including California redwood with a ~30-Gb hexaploid genome, we show that hifiasm frequently delivers better assemblies than existing tools and consistently outperforms others on haplotype-resolved assembly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheng","given":"Haoyu"},{"family":"Concepcion","given":"Gregory T."},{"family":"Feng","given":"Xiaowen"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Haowen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Heng"}],"container-title":"Nature Methods","DOI":"10.1038/s41592-020-01056-5","ISSN":"1548-7105","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","number":"2","page":"170-175","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Haplotype-resolved de novo assembly using phased assembly graphs with hifiasm","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01056-5","volume":"18"},

Genetics of gene expression (GOGE) studies have identified cis-acting regulatory variants of many genes; however, few trans-acting variants have yet been identified.In humans, ∼30–50% of cis-acting variants identified in immortalized B cells have the same effects in other cell types, such as adipose tissue and blood.Differences in genotype frequencies of regulatory alleles contribute to population differences in gene expression.By combining results from GOGE studies with correlation analysis, one can construct directed gene co-expression networks that provide information on causal rather than just correlative relationships. The results also extend regulatory relationships from pairs to groups of genes.GOGE studies in cells exposed to cellular, medical or environmental perturbations will uncover additional regulators of human gene expression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheung","given":"Vivian G."},{"family":"Spielman","given":"Richard S."}],"container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/nrg2630","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9]]},"language":"en","number":"9","page":"595-604","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Genetics of human gene expression: mapping DNA variants that influence gene expression","title-short":"Genetics of human gene expression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2630","volume":"10"},

In large part, this was fueled by advances in genomic technology, enabling us to examine genome-wide genetic variants across diverse genetic materials. The development of the mixed model framework for GWAS dramatically reduced the number of false positives compared with naïve methods. Building on this foundation, many methods have since been developed to increase computational speed or improve statistical power in GWAS. These methods have allowed the detection of genomic variants associated with either traditional agronomic phenotypes or biochemical and molecular phenotypes. In turn, these associations enable applications in gene cloning and in accelerated crop breeding through marker assisted selection or genetic engineering. Current topics of investigation include rare-variant analysis, synthetic associations, optimizing the choice of GWAS model, and utilizing GWAS results to advance knowledge of biological processes.

  {"id":"cummings2020","abstract":"The acceleration of DNA sequencing in samples from patients and population studies has resulted in extensive catalogues of human genetic variation, but the interpretation of rare genetic variants remains problematic. A notable example of this challenge is the existence of disruptive variants in dosage-sensitive disease genes, even in apparently healthy individuals. Here, by manual curation of putative loss-of-function (pLoF) variants in haploinsufficient disease genes in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)1, we show that one explanation for this paradox involves alternative splicing of mRNA, which allows exons of a gene to be expressed at varying levels across different cell types. Currently, no existing annotation tool systematically incorporates information about exon expression into the interpretation of variants. We develop a transcript-level annotation metric known as the ‘proportion expressed across transcripts’, which quantifies isoform expression for variants. We calculate this metric using 11,706 tissue samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project2 and show that it can differentiate between weakly and highly evolutionarily conserved exons, a proxy for functional importance. We demonstrate that expression-based annotation selectively filters 22.8% of falsely annotated pLoF variants found in haploinsufficient disease genes in gnomAD, while removing less than 4% of high-confidence pathogenic variants in the same genes. Finally, we apply our expression filter to the analysis of de novo variants in patients with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability or developmental disorders to show that pLoF variants in weakly expressed regions have similar effect sizes to those of synonymous variants, whereas pLoF variants in highly expressed exons are most strongly enriched among cases. Our annotation is fast, flexible and generalizable, making it possible for any variant file to be annotated with any isoform expression dataset, and will be valuable for the genetic diagnosis of rare diseases, the analysis of rare variant burden in complex disorders, and the curation and prioritization of variants in recall-by-genotype studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Cummings","given":"Beryl B."},{"family":"Karczewski","given":"Konrad J."},{"family":"Kosmicki","given":"Jack A."},{"family":"Seaby","given":"Eleanor G."},{"family":"Watts","given":"Nicholas A."},{"family":"Singer-Berk","given":"Moriel"},{"family":"Mudge","given":"Jonathan M."},{"family":"Karjalainen","given":"Juha"},{"family":"Satterstrom","given":"F.

  {"id":"dellacqua2015","abstract":"Background: Maize (Zea mays) is a globally produced crop with broad genetic and phenotypic variation. New tools that improve our understanding of the genetic basis of quantitative traits are needed to guide predictive crop breeding. We have produced the first balanced multi-parental population in maize, a tool that provides high diversity and dense recombination events to allow routine quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in maize.\nResults: We produced 1,636 MAGIC maize recombinant inbred lines derived from eight genetically diverse founder lines. The characterization of 529 MAGIC maize lines shows that the population is a balanced, evenly differentiated mosaic of the eight founders, with mapping power and resolution strengthened by high minor allele frequencies and a fast decay of linkage disequilibrium. We show how MAGIC maize may find strong candidate genes by incorporating genome sequencing and transcriptomics data. We discuss three QTL for grain yield and three for flowering time, reporting candidate genes. Power simulations show that subsets of MAGIC maize might achieve high-power and high-definition QTL mapping.\nConclusions: We demonstrate MAGIC maize’s value in identifying the genetic bases of complex traits of agronomic relevance. The design of MAGIC maize allows the accumulation of sequencing and transcriptomics layers to guide the identification of candidate genes for a number of maize traits at different developmental stages. The characterization of the full MAGIC maize population will lead to higher power and definition in QTL mapping, and lay the basis for improved understanding of maize phenotypes, heterosis included.

If the anonymous traffic can be effectively identified, the abuse of such technology can be prevented. Since the study of machine learning is rapidly developing these years, this paper applies the Random Forest Algorithm --- a semi-supervised learning method --- into the traffic detection of Shadowsocks. We can get over 85% detection accuracy rate in our experiments after applying Random Forest Algorithm by collecting train set, gathering features, training models and predicting results. With the scale of train set and test set increase, the detection accuracy rate gradually increases until it becomes constant. We will make several adjustments on train set, test set and feature set to reduce the false alarm rate and false rate when detecting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Deng","given":"Ziye"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zihan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhouguo"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yubin"}],"container-title":"2017 9th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC)","DOI":"10.1109/IHMSC.2017.132","event":"2017 9th International Conference on Intelligent Human-Machine Systems and Cybernetics (IHMSC)","event-place":"Hangzhou","ISBN":"978-1-5386-3021-1 978-1-5386-3022-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8]]},"language":"en","page":"75-78","publisher":"IEEE","publisher-place":"Hangzhou","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Random Forest Based Detection of Shadowsock's Traffic","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8048116/"},

  {"id":"desai2021","abstract":"Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression (‘noise’) are often considered detrimental, but fluctuations can also be exploited for benefit (e.g., dither). We show here that DNA base-excision repair amplifies transcriptional noise to facilitate cellular reprogramming. Specifically, the DNA-repair protein Apex1, which recognizes both naturally occurring and unnatural base modifications, amplifies expression noise while homeostatically maintaining mean-expression levels. This amplified expression noise originates from shorter duration, higher intensity, transcriptional bursts generated by Apex1-mediated DNA supercoiling. The remodeling of DNA topology first impedes and then accelerates transcription to maintain mean levels. This mechanism, which we term Discordant Transcription through Repair (DiThR; pronounced /’dither’/), potentiates cellular reprogramming and differentiation. Our study reveals a potential functional role for transcriptional fluctuations mediated by DNA base modifications in embryonic development and disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Desai","given":"Ravi V."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xinyue"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Chaturvedi","given":"Sonali"},{"family":"Hwang","given":"Dong Woo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Weihan"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Thomson","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Singer","given":"Robert H."},{"family":"Coleman","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Maike M.

One important reason for this is that the outcome of a mutation can depend on the genetic context in which it occurs. This dependency is known as epistasis. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to quantify the extent of pairwise and higher-order genetic interactions between mutations through deep mutagenesis of proteins and RNAs. This research has revealed two major components of epistasis: nonspecific genetic interactions caused by nonlinearities in genotype-to-phenotype maps, and specific interactions between particular mutations.

Most accessions with domestication-related traits experienced geographic isolation. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 98 significant peak associations for 11 agronomically important traits in G. arboreum. A nonsynonymous substitution (cysteine-to-arginine substitution) of GaKASIII seems to confer substantial fatty acid composition (C16:0 and C16:1) changes in cotton seeds.

  {"id":"dudbridge2008","abstract":"The question of what significance threshold is appropriate for genomewide association studies is somewhat unresolved. Previous theoretical suggestions have yet to be validated in practice, whereas permutation testing does not resolve a discrepancy between the genomewide multiplicity of the experiment and the subset of markers actually tested. We used genotypes from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium to estimate a genomewide significance threshold for the UK Caucasian population. We subsampled the genotypes at increasing densities, using permutation to estimate the nominal P-value for 5% family-wise error. By extrapolating to infinite density, we estimated the genomewide significance threshold to be about 7.2 × 10−8. To reduce the computation time, we considered Patterson's eigenvalue estimator of the effective number of tests, but found it to be an order of magnitude too low for multiplicity correction. However, by fitting a Beta distribution to the minimum P-value from permutation replicates, we showed that the effective number is a useful heuristic and suggest that its estimation in this context is an open problem. We conclude that permutation is still needed to obtain genomewide significance thresholds, but with subsampling, extrapolation and estimation of an effective number of tests, the threshold can be standardized for all studies of the same population.

We determined that drug target genes with five genetic features—tissue specificity of gene expression, Mendelian associations, phenotype- and tissue-level effects of genome-wide association (GWA) loci driven by eQTL, and genetic constraint—confer a 2.6-fold greater risk of side effects, compared to genes without such features. The presence of eQTL in multiple tissues resulted in more unique phenotypes driven by GWA loci, suggesting that drugs delivered to multiple tissues can induce several side effects.

  {"id":"fang2019","abstract":"Genetic interactions have been reported to underlie phenotypes in a variety of systems, but the extent to which they contribute to complex disease in humans remains unclear. In principle, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a platform for detecting genetic interactions, but existing methods for identifying them from GWAS data tend to focus on testing individual locus pairs, which undermines statistical power. Importantly, a global genetic network mapped for a model eukaryotic organism revealed that genetic interactions often connect genes between compensatory functional modules in a highly coherent manner. Taking advantage of this expected structure, we developed a computational approach called BridGE that identifies pathways connected by genetic interactions from GWAS data. Applying BridGE broadly, we discover significant interactions in Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, hypertension, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Our novel approach provides a general framework for mapping complex genetic networks underlying human disease from genome-wide genotype data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Fang","given":"Gang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wen"},{"family":"Paunic","given":"Vanja"},{"family":"Heydari","given":"Hamed"},{"family":"Costanzo","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaoye"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaotong"},{"family":"VanderSluis","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Oately","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Steinbach","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Van Ness","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Schadt","given":"Eric E."},{"family":"Pankratz","given":"Nathan D."},{"family":"Boone","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Vipin"},{"family":"Myers","given":"Chad L."}],"container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-019-12131-7","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,19]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"4274","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Discovering genetic interactions bridging pathways in genome-wide association studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12131-7","volume":"10"},

However, productivity varies greatly across the globe and is under threat from both increased competitions for land and climate change and associated environmental deterioration. Moreover, the increase in human population size and dietary changes are putting an ever greater burden on agriculture. The majority of this burden is met by the cultivation of a very small number of species, largely in locations that differ from their origin of domestication. Recent technological advances have raised the possibility of de novo domestication of wild plants as a viable solution for designing ideal crops while maintaining food security and a more sustainable low-input agriculture.

  {"id":"fisher1919","abstract":"Several attempts have already been made to interpret the well-established results of biometry in accordance with the Mendelian scheme of inheritance. It is here attempted to ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations σ\n              1\n              and σ\n              2\n              , it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation\n              \n              . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of the total variance which they together produce. It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the “percentage of causation,” which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Fisher","given":"R.

We use fine-mapping to quantify the probability that each eSTR is causal and characterize the top 1,400 fine-mapped eSTRs. We identify hundreds of eSTRs linked with published genome-wide association study signals and implicate specific eSTRs in complex traits, including height, schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease and intelligence.

We present a tomato pan-genome constructed using genome sequences of 725 phylogenetically and geographically representative accessions, revealing 4,873 genes absent from the reference genome. Presence/absence variation analyses reveal substantial gene loss and intense negative selection of genes and promoters during tomato domestication and improvement. Lost or negatively selected genes are enriched for important traits, especially disease resistance. We identify a rare allele in the TomLoxC promoter selected against during domestication. Quantitative trait locus mapping and analysis of transgenic plants reveal a role for TomLoxC in apocarotenoid production, which contributes to desirable tomato flavor. In orange-stage fruit, accessions harboring both the rare and common TomLoxC alleles (heterozygotes) have higher TomLoxC expression than those homozygous for either and are resurgent in modern tomatoes. The tomato pan-genome adds depth and completeness to the reference genome, and is useful for future biological discovery and breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Gao","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Gonda","given":"Itay"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Honghe"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Qiyue"},{"family":"Bao","given":"Kan"},{"family":"Tieman","given":"Denise M."},{"family":"Burzynski-Chang","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Fish","given":"Tara L."},{"family":"Stromberg","given":"Kaitlin A."},{"family":"Sacks","given":"Gavin L."},{"family":"Thannhauser","given":"Theodore W."},{"family":"Foolad","given":"Majid R."},{"family":"Diez","given":"Maria Jose"},{"family":"Blanca","given":"Jose"},{"family":"Canizares","given":"Joaquin"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Yimin"},{"family":"Knaap","given":"Esther","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Sanwen"},{"family":"Klee","given":"Harry J."},{"family":"Giovannoni","given":"James J."},{"family":"Fei","given":"Zhangjun"}],"container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-019-0410-2","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Genomics;Plant genetics;Population genetics\nSubject_term_id: genomics;plant-genetics;population-genetics","number":"6","page":"1044-1051","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The tomato pan-genome uncovers new genes and a rare allele regulating fruit flavor","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0410-2","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"garg2021","abstract":"Haplotype-resolved or phased genome assembly provides a complete picture of genomes and their complex genetic variations. However, current algorithms for phased assembly either do not generate chromosome-scale phasing or require pedigree information, which limits their application. We present a method named diploid assembly (DipAsm) that uses long, accurate reads and long-range conformation data for single individuals to generate a chromosome-scale phased assembly within 1 day. Applied to four public human genomes, PGP1, HG002, NA12878 and HG00733, DipAsm produced haplotype-resolved assemblies with minimum contig length needed to cover 50% of the known genome (NG50) up to 25 Mb and phased ~99.5% of heterozygous sites at 98–99% accuracy, outperforming other approaches in terms of both contiguity and phasing completeness. We demonstrate the importance of chromosome-scale phased assemblies for the discovery of structural variants (SVs), including thousands of new transposon insertions, and of highly polymorphic and medically important regions such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) regions. DipAsm will facilitate high-quality precision medicine and studies of individual haplotype variation and population diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Garg","given":"Shilpa"},{"family":"Fungtammasan","given":"Arkarachai"},{"family":"Carroll","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Chou","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Schmitt","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Mac","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Peluso","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Hatas","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Ghurye","given":"Jay"},{"family":"Maguire","given":"Jared"},{"family":"Mahmoud","given":"Medhat"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Haoyu"},{"family":"Heller","given":"David"},{"family":"Zook","given":"Justin M."},{"family":"Moemke","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Marschall","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Sedlazeck","given":"Fritz J."},{"family":"Aach","given":"John"},{"family":"Chin","given":"Chen-Shan"},{"family":"Church","given":"George M."},{"family":"Li","given":"Heng"}],"container-title":"Nature Biotechnology","DOI":"10.1038/s41587-020-0711-0","ISSN":"1546-1696","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3]]},"language":"en","number":"3","page":"309-312","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Chromosome-scale, haplotype-resolved assembly of human genomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0711-0","volume":"39"},

We report results from the first genome-wide association meta-analysis of six studies including 1556 FMD cases and 7100 controls. We find an estimate of SNP-based heritability compatible with FMD having a polygenic basis, and report four robustly associated loci (PHACTR1, LRP1, ATP2B1, and LIMA1). Transcriptome-wide association analysis in arteries identifies one additional locus (SLC24A3). We characterize open chromatin in arterial primary cells and find that FMD associated variants are located in arterial-specific regulatory elements. Target genes are broadly involved in mechanisms related to actin cytoskeleton and intracellular calcium homeostasis, central to vascular contraction. We find significant genetic overlap between FMD and more common cardiovascular diseases and traits including blood pressure, migraine, intracranial aneurysm, and coronary artery disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Georges","given":"Adrien"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Min-Lee"},{"family":"Berrandou","given":"Takiy-Eddine"},{"family":"Bakker","given":"Mark K."},{"family":"Dikilitas","given":"Ozan"},{"family":"Kiando","given":"Soto Romuald"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Lijiang"},{"family":"Satterfield","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Sengupta","given":"Sebanti"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Mengyao"},{"family":"Deleuze","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Dupré","given":"Delia"},{"family":"Hunker","given":"Kristina L."},{"family":"Kyryachenko","given":"Sergiy"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Sayoud-Sadeg","given":"Ines"},{"family":"Amar","given":"Laurence"},{"family":"Brummett","given":"Chad M."},{"family":"Coleman","given":"Dawn M."},{"family":"Escamard","given":"Valentina","non-dropping-particle":"d’"},{"family":"Leeuw","given":"Peter","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Fendrikova-Mahlay","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Kadian-Dodov","given":"Daniella"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jun Z."},{"family":"Lorthioir","given":"Aurélien"},{"family":"Pappaccogli","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Prejbisz","given":"Aleksander"},{"family":"Smigielski","given":"Witold"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"James C."},{"family":"Zawistowski","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Zöllner","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Leeuw","given":"Peter","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Amouyel","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"De Buyzere","given":"Marc L."},{"family":"Debette","given":"Stéphanie"},{"family":"Dobrowolski","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Drygas","given":"Wojciech"},{"family":"Gornik","given":"Heather L."},{"family":"Olin","given":"Jeffrey W."},{"family":"Piwonski","given":"Jerzy"},{"family":"Rietzschel","given":"Ernst R."},{"family":"Ruigrok","given":"Ynte M."},{"family":"Vikkula","given":"Miikka"},{"family":"Warchol Celinska","given":"Ewa"},{"family":"Januszewicz","given":"Andrzej"},{"family":"Kullo","given":"Iftikhar J."},{"family":"Azizi","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Jeunemaitre","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Persu","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Kovacic","given":"Jason C."},{"family":"Ganesh","given":"Santhi K."},{"family":"Bouatia-Naji","given":"Nabila"}],"container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-26174-2","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,15]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Cardiovascular diseases;Genetics research;Genome-wide association studies\nSubject_term_id: cardiovascular-diseases;genetics-research;genome-wide-association-studies","number":"1","page":"6031","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Genetic investigation of fibromuscular dysplasia identifies risk loci and shared genetics with common cardiovascular diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26174-2","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"giambartolomei2014","abstract":"Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study (GWAS) design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits, in particular cardiovascular diseases and lipid biomarkers. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including >100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results, hence highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In three cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs (SYPL2, IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with SORT1, GCKR, and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (implemented online at http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases as well as the design of drugs to target disease pathways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Giambartolomei","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Vukcevic","given":"Damjan"},{"family":"Schadt","given":"Eric E."},{"family":"Franke","given":"Lude"},{"family":"Hingorani","given":"Aroon D."},{"family":"Wallace","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Plagnol","given":"Vincent"}],"container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1004383","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,15]]},"language":"en","page":"e1004383","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Bayesian Test for Colocalisation between Pairs of Genetic Association Studies Using Summary Statistics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004383","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"gokhman2021","abstract":"Gene regulatory divergence is thought to play a central role in determining human-specific traits. However, our ability to link divergent regulation to divergent phenotypes is limited. Here, we utilized human–chimpanzee hybrid induced pluripotent stem cells to study gene expression separating these species. The tetraploid hybrid cells allowed us to separate cis- from trans-regulatory effects, and to control for nongenetic confounding factors. We differentiated these cells into cranial neural crest cells, the primary cell type giving rise to the face. We discovered evidence of lineage-specific selection on the hedgehog signaling pathway, including a human-specific sixfold down-regulation of EVC2 (LIMBIN), a key hedgehog gene. Inducing a similar down-regulation of EVC2 substantially reduced hedgehog signaling output. Mice and humans lacking functional EVC2 show striking phenotypic parallels to human–chimpanzee craniofacial differences, suggesting that the regulatory divergence of hedgehog signaling may have contributed to the unique craniofacial morphology of humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Gokhman","given":"David"},{"family":"Agoglia","given":"Rachel M."},{"family":"Kinnebrew","given":"Maia"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Danqiong"},{"family":"Bajpai","given":"Vivek K."},{"family":"Naqvi","given":"Sahin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Coral"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Chider"},{"family":"Petrov","given":"Dmitri A."},{"family":"Ahituv","given":"Nadav"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Honghao"},{"family":"Mishina","given":"Yuji"},{"family":"Wysocka","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Rohatgi","given":"Rajat"},{"family":"Fraser","given":"Hunter B."}],"container-title":"Nature Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00804-3","ISSN":"1546-1718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"language":"en","page":"1-10","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Human–chimpanzee fused cells reveal cis -regulatory divergence underlying skeletal evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00804-3"},

We used integrative analysis to develop a unified set of chromatin state annotations, infer the identities of dynamic enhancers and key transcriptional regulators, and characterize the relationship between chromatin state and accessibility during developmental gene regulation. We also leveraged these data to link enhancers to putative target genes and demonstrate tissue-specific enrichments of sequence variants associated with disease in humans.

Here we assayed gene expression in rice (Oryza sativa)3, and used phenotypic selection analysis to estimate the type and strength of selection on the levels of more than 15,000 transcripts4,5. Variation in most transcripts appears (nearly) neutral or under very weak stabilizing selection in wet paddy conditions (with median standardized selection differentials near zero), but selection is stronger under drought conditions. Overall, more transcripts are conditionally neutral (2.83%) than are antagonistically pleiotropic6 (0.04%), and transcripts that display lower levels of expression and stochastic noise7–9 and higher levels of plasticity9 are under stronger selection. Selection strength was further weakly negatively associated with levels of cis-regulation and network connectivity9. Our multivariate analysis suggests that selection acts on the expression of photosynthesis genes4,5, but that the efficacy of selection is genetically constrained under drought conditions10. Drought selected for earlier flowering11,12 and a higher expression of OsMADS18 (Os07g0605200), which encodes a MADS-box transcription factor and is a known regulator of early flowering13—marking this gene as a drought-escape gene11,12.

Here, to address these questions as part of phase III of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), we mapped cohesin-mediated chromatin loops, using chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), and analysed gene expression in 24 diverse human cell types, including core ENCODE cell lines. Twenty-eight per cent of all chromatin loops vary across cell types; these variations modestly correlate with changes in gene expression and are effective at grouping cell types according to their tissue of origin. The connectivity of genes corresponds to different functional classes, with housekeeping genes having few contacts, and dosage-sensitive genes being more connected to enhancer elements. This atlas of chromatin loops complements the diverse maps of regulatory architecture that comprise the ENCODE Encyclopedia, and will help to support emerging analyses of genome structure and function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Grubert","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Srivas","given":"Rohith"},{"family":"Spacek","given":"Damek V."},{"family":"Kasowski","given":"Maya"},{"family":"Ruiz-Velasco","given":"Mariana"},{"family":"Sinnott-Armstrong","given":"Nasa"},{"family":"Greenside","given":"Peyton"},{"family":"Narasimha","given":"Anil"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Geller","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Sanghi","given":"Akshay"},{"family":"Kulik","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Sa","given":"Silin"},{"family":"Rabinovitch","given":"Marlene"},{"family":"Kundaje","given":"Anshul"},{"family":"Dalton","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Zaugg","given":"Judith B."},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Michael"}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2151-x","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7818","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"language":"en","number":"7818","page":"737-743","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Landscape of cohesin-mediated chromatin loops in the human genome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2151-x","volume":"583"},

We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression.

Methods to analyse these data, based on maximum-likelihood, have been developed and provide good estimates of QTL effects in some situations. Maximum-likelihood methods are, however, relatively complex and can be computationally slow. In this paper we develop methods for mapping QTL based on multiple regression which can be applied using any general statistical package. We use the example of mapping in an F2 population and show that these regression methods produce very similar results to those obtained using maximum likelihood. The relative simplicity of the regression methods means that models with more than a single QTL can be explored and we give examples of two linked loci and of two interacting loci. Other models, for example with more than two QTL, with environmental fixed effects, with between family variance or for threshold traits, could be fitted in a similar way. The ease, speed of application and generality of regression methods for flanking marker analyses, and the good estimates they obtain, suggest that they should provide the method of choice for the analysis of QTL mapping data from inbred line crosses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Haley","given":"C.

  {"id":"he2021","abstract":"Large-scale genomic surveys of crop germplasm are important for understanding the genetic architecture of favorable traits. The genomic basis of geographic differentiation and fiber improvement in cultivated cotton is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed 3,248 tetraploid cotton genomes and confirmed that the extensive chromosome inversions on chromosomes A06 and A08 underlies the geographic differentiation in cultivated Gossypium hirsutum. We further revealed that the haplotypic diversity originated from landraces, which might be essential for understanding adaptative evolution in cultivated cotton. Introgression and association analyses identified new fiber quality-related loci and demonstrated that the introgressed alleles from two diploid cottons had a large effect on fiber quality improvement. These loci provided the potential power to overcome the bottleneck in fiber quality improvement. Our study uncovered several critical genomic signatures generated by historical breeding effects in cotton and a wealth of data that enrich genomic resources for the research community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,21]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Shoupu"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Gaofei"},{"family":"Geng","given":"Xiaoli"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Wenfang"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Panhong"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Yinhua"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Weijun"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Zhaoe"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Junduo"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Liyuan"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Songhua"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Baojun"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Shufang"},{"family":"You","given":"Chunyuan"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Zongming"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Guoyong"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Daowu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Liru"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Baoyin"},{"family":"Du","given":"Xiongming"}],"container-title":"Nature Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00844-9","ISSN":"1546-1718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,15]]},"language":"en","page":"1-9","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"The genomic basis of geographic differentiation and fiber improvement in cultivated cotton","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00844-9"},

The biological rationale for this phenomenon is to promote physiological adaptations to the anticipated environment based on early life experience. However, perinatal exposure to adverse environments can also be associated with adult-onset disorders. Multiple environmental stressors induce glucocorticoids, which prompted us to investigate their role in developmental programming. Here, we report that perinatal glucocorticoid exposure had long-term consequences and resulted in diminished CD8 T cell response in adulthood and impaired control of tumor growth and bacterial infection. We found that perinatal glucocorticoid exposure resulted in persistent alteration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Consequently, the level of the hormone in adults was significantly reduced, resulting in decreased CD8 T cell function. Our study thus demonstrates that perinatal stress can have long-term consequences on CD8 T cell immunity by altering HPA axis activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Hong","given":"Jun Young"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Jaechul"},{"family":"Carvalho","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Cho","given":"Jen Young"},{"family":"Vaidyanathan","given":"Bharat"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Shuang"},{"family":"Annicelli","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Ip","given":"W.

  {"id":"hormozdiari2016a","abstract":"The vast majority of genome-wide association study (GWAS) risk loci fall in non-coding regions of the genome. One possible hypothesis is that these GWAS risk loci alter the individual’s disease risk through their effect on gene expression in different tissues. In order to understand the mechanisms driving a GWAS risk locus, it is helpful to determine which gene is affected in specific tissue types. For example, the relevant gene and tissue could play a role in the disease mechanism if the same variant responsible for a GWAS locus also affects gene expression. Identifying whether or not the same variant is causal in both GWASs and expression quantitative trail locus (eQTL) studies is challenging because of the uncertainty induced by linkage disequilibrium and the fact that some loci harbor multiple causal variants. However, current methods that address this problem assume that each locus contains a single causal variant. In this paper, we present eCAVIAR, a probabilistic method that has several key advantages over existing methods. First, our method can account for more than one causal variant in any given locus. Second, it can leverage summary statistics without accessing the individual genotype data. We use both simulated and real datasets to demonstrate the utility of our method. Using publicly available eQTL data on 45 different tissues, we demonstrate that eCAVIAR can prioritize likely relevant tissues and target genes for a set of glucose- and insulin-related trait loci.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hormozdiari","given":"Farhad"},{"family":"Bunt","given":"Martijn","non-dropping-particle":"van de"},{"family":"Segrè","given":"Ayellet V."},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Joo","given":"Jong Wha J."},{"family":"Bilow","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Sul","given":"Jae Hoon"},{"family":"Sankararaman","given":"Sriram"},{"family":"Pasaniuc","given":"Bogdan"},{"family":"Eskin","given":"Eleazar"}],"container-title":"The American Journal of Human Genetics","container-title-short":"The American Journal of Human Genetics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.10.003","ISSN":"0002-9297","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1245-1260","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Colocalization of GWAS and eQTL Signals Detects Target Genes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929716304396","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"hu2020","abstract":"Polyploidy is a widespread phenomenon throughout eukaryotes. Due to the coexistence of duplicated genomes, polyploids offer unique challenges for estimating gene expression levels, which is essential for understanding the massive and various forms of transcriptomic responses accompanying polyploidy. Although previous studies have explored the bioinformatics of polyploid transcriptomic profiling, the causes and consequences of inaccurate quantification of transcripts from duplicated gene copies have not been addressed. Using transcriptomic data from the cotton genus (Gossypium) as an example, we present an analytical workflow to evaluate a variety of bioinformatic method choices at different stages of RNA-seq analysis, from homoeolog expression quantification to downstream analysis used to infer key phenomena of polyploid expression evolution. In general, EAGLE-RC and GSNAP-PolyCat outperform other quantification pipelines tested, and their derived expression dataset best represents the expected homoeolog expression and co-expression divergence. The performance of co-expression network analysis was less affected by homoeolog quantification than by network construction methods, where weighted networks outperformed binary networks. By examining the extent and consequences of homoeolog read ambiguity, we illuminate the potential artifacts that may affect our understanding of duplicate gene expression, including an overestimation of homoeolog co-regulation and the incorrect inference of subgenome asymmetry in network topology. Taken together, our work points to a set of reasonable practices that we hope are broadly applicable to the evolutionary exploration of polyploids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Guanjing"},{"family":"Grover","given":"Corrinne E"},{"family":"Arick","given":"Mark A","suffix":"II"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Meiling"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Daniel G"},{"family":"Wendel","given":"Jonathan F"}],"container-title":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Briefings Bioinf.","DOI":"10.1093/bib/bbaa035","ISSN":"1477-4054","issue":"bbaa035","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,27]]},"source":"Silverchair","title":"Homoeologous gene expression and co-expression network analyses and evolutionary inference in allopolyploids","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa035"},

  {"id":"huang2012b","abstract":"Crop domestications are long-term selection experiments that have greatly advanced human civilization. The domestication of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) ranks as one of the most important developments in history. However, its origins and domestication processes are controversial and have long been debated. Here we generate genome sequences from 446 geographically diverse accessions of the wild rice species Oryza rufipogon, the immediate ancestral progenitor of cultivated rice, and from 1,083 cultivated indica and japonica varieties to construct a comprehensive map of rice genome variation. In the search for signatures of selection, we identify 55 selective sweeps that have occurred during domestication. In-depth analyses of the domestication sweeps and genome-wide patterns reveal that Oryza sativa japonica rice was first domesticated from a specific population of O. rufipogon around the middle area of the Pearl River in southern China, and that Oryza sativa indica rice was subsequently developed from crosses between japonica rice and local wild rice as the initial cultivars spread into South East and South Asia. The domestication-associated traits are analysed through high-resolution genetic mapping. This study provides an important resource for rice breeding and an effective genomics approach for crop domestication research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Xuehui"},{"family":"Kurata","given":"Nori"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Xinghua"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zi-Xuan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ahong"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Kunyan"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Hengyun"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenjun"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yunli"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Yiqi"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Congcong"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Danlin"},{"family":"Weng","given":"Qijun"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Chuanrang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yongchun"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Furuumi","given":"Hiroyasu"},{"family":"Kubo","given":"Takahiko"},{"family":"Miyabayashi","given":"Toshie"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Xiaoping"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Qun"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Guojun"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Qilin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Canyang"},{"family":"Fujiyama","given":"Asao"},{"family":"Toyoda","given":"Atsushi"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Tingting"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiayang"},{"family":"Han","given":"Bin"}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature11532","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7421","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,10]]},"language":"en","number":"7421","page":"497-501","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A map of rice genome variation reveals the origin of cultivated rice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11532","volume":"490"},

  {"id":"huang2021","abstract":"Cotton is not only the world's most important natural fiber crop, but it is also an ideal system in which to study genome evolution, polyploidization, and cell elongation. With the assembly of five different cotton genomes, a cotton-specific whole-genome duplication with an allopolyploidization process that combined the A- and D-genomes became evident. All existing A-genomes seemed to originate from the A0-genome as a common ancestor, and several transposable element bursts contributed to A-genome size expansion and speciation. The ethylene production pathway is shown to regulate fiber elongation. A tip-biased diffuse growth mode and several regulatory mechanisms, including plant hormones, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifications, are involved in fiber development. Finally, we describe the involvement of the gossypol biosynthetic pathway in the manipulation of herbivorous insects, the role of GoPGF in gland formation, and host-induced gene silencing for pest and disease control. These new genes, modules, and pathways will accelerate the genetic improvement of cotton. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Plant Biology, Volume 72 is May 2021.

  {"id":"hufford2021","abstract":"An a-maize-ing set of genomes\nMaize is an important crop that is cultivated worldwide. As maize spread across the world, selection for local environments resulted in variation, but the impact on differences between the genome has not been quantified. By producing high-quality genomic sequences of the 26 lines used in the maize nested association mapping panel, Hufford et al. map important traits and demonstrate the diversity of maize. Examining RNA and methylation of genes across accessions, the authors identified a core set of maize genes. Beyond this core set, comparative analysis across lines identified high levels of variation in the total set of genes, the maize pan-genome. The value of this resource was further exemplified by mapping quantitative traits of interest, including those related to pathogen resistance.\nScience, abg5289, this issue p. 655\nWe report de novo genome assemblies, transcriptomes, annotations, and methylomes for the 26 inbreds that serve as the founders for the maize nested association mapping population. The number of pan-genes in these diverse genomes exceeds 103,000, with approximately a third found across all genotypes. The results demonstrate that the ancient tetraploid character of maize continues to degrade by fractionation to the present day. Excellent contiguity over repeat arrays and complete annotation of centromeres revealed additional variation in major cytological landmarks. We show that combining structural variation with single-nucleotide polymorphisms can improve the power of quantitative mapping studies. We also document variation at the level of DNA methylation and demonstrate that unmethylated regions are enriched for cis-regulatory elements that contribute to phenotypic variation.\nA multigenome analysis of maize reveals variation in gene content, genome structure, and methylation.\nA multigenome analysis of maize reveals variation in gene content, genome structure, and methylation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Hufford","given":"Matthew B."},{"family":"Seetharam","given":"Arun S."},{"family":"Woodhouse","given":"Margaret R."},{"family":"Chougule","given":"Kapeel M."},{"family":"Ou","given":"Shujun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jianing"},{"family":"Ricci","given":"William A."},{"family":"Guo","given":"Tingting"},{"family":"Olson","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Yinjie"},{"family":"Coletta","given":"Rafael Della"},{"family":"Tittes","given":"Silas"},{"family":"Hudson","given":"Asher I."},{"family":"Marand","given":"Alexandre P."},{"family":"Wei","given":"Sharon"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Zhenyuan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Tello-Ruiz","given":"Marcela K."},{"family":"Piri","given":"Rebecca D."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Na"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Dong","dropping-particle":"won"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Yibing"},{"family":"O’Connor","given":"Christine H."},{"family":"Li","given":"Xianran"},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"Amanda M."},{"family":"Baggs","given":"Erin"},{"family":"Krasileva","given":"Ksenia V."},{"family":"Portwood","given":"John L."},{"family":"Cannon","given":"Ethalinda K.

Outlook 918 Acknowledgements 919 References 919 Summary Association mapping is rapidly becoming the main method for dissecting the genetic architecture of complex traits in plants. Currently most association mapping studies in plants are preformed using sets of genes selected to be putative candidates for the trait of interest, but rapid developments in genomics will allow for genome-wide mapping in virtually any plant species in the near future. As the costs for genotyping are decreasing, the focus has shifted towards phenotyping. In plants, clonal replication and/or inbred lines allows for replicated phenotyping under many different environmental conditions. Reduced sequencing costs will increase the number of studies that use RNA sequencing data to perform expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, which will increase our knowledge of how gene expression variation contributes to phenotypic variation. Current population sizes used in association mapping studies are modest in size and need to be greatly increased if mutations explaining less than a few per cent of the phenotypic variation are to be detected. Association mapping has started to yield insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits in plants, and future studies with greater genome coverage will help to elucidate how plants have managed to adapt to a wide variety of environmental conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ingvarsson","given":"Pär K."},{"family":"Street","given":"Nathaniel R."}],"container-title":"New Phytologist","DOI":"10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03593.x","ISSN":"1469-8137","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03593.x","page":"909-922","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Association genetics of complex traits in plants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03593.x","volume":"189"},

Although hypothesized to serve important regulatory functions, physiologic roles of the minor spliceosome are not well understood. For example, the minor spliceosome component ZRSR2 is subject to recurrent, leukemia-associated mutations, yet functional connections among minor introns, hematopoiesis and cancers are unclear. Here, we identify that impaired minor intron excision via ZRSR2 loss enhances hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal. CRISPR screens mimicking nonsense-mediated decay of minor intron-containing mRNA species converged on LZTR1, a regulator of RAS-related GTPases. LZTR1 minor intron retention was also discovered in the RASopathy Noonan syndrome, due to intronic mutations disrupting splicing and diverse solid tumors. These data uncover minor intron recognition as a regulator of hematopoiesis, noncoding mutations within minor introns as potential cancer drivers and links among ZRSR2 mutations, LZTR1 regulation and leukemias.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Inoue","given":"Daichi"},{"family":"Polaski","given":"Jacob T."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Castel","given":"Pau"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Sisi"},{"family":"Kobayashi","given":"Susumu"},{"family":"Hogg","given":"Simon J."},{"family":"Hayashi","given":"Yasutaka"},{"family":"Pineda","given":"Jose Mario Bello"},{"family":"El Marabti","given":"Ettaib"},{"family":"Erickson","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Knorr","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Fukumoto","given":"Miki"},{"family":"Yamazaki","given":"Hiromi"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Atsushi"},{"family":"Fukui","given":"Chie"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Sydney X."},{"family":"Durham","given":"Benjamin H."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Mehta","given":"Sanjoy"},{"family":"Zakheim","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Garippa","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Penson","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Chew","given":"Guo-Liang"},{"family":"McCormick","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Bradley","given":"Robert K."},{"family":"Abdel-Wahab","given":"Omar"}],"container-title":"Nature Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00828-9","ISSN":"1546-1718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1-12","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Minor intron retention drives clonal hematopoietic disorders and diverse cancer predisposition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00828-9"},

Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers ∼99% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of ∼1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000–25,000 protein-coding genes.

However, why and how inversions become associated with polymorphic traits remains obscure. Here we show that despite a strong selective advantage when they form, inversions accumulate recessive deleterious mutations that generate frequency-dependent selection and promote their maintenance at intermediate frequency. Combining genomics and in vivo fitness analyses in a model butterfly for wing-pattern polymorphism, Heliconius numata, we reveal that three ecologically advantageous inversions have built up a heavy mutational load from the sequential accumulation of deleterious mutations and transposable elements. Inversions associate with sharply reduced viability when homozygous, which prevents them from replacing ancestral chromosome arrangements. Our results suggest that other complex polymorphisms, rather than representing adaptations to competing ecological optima, could evolve because chromosomal rearrangements are intrinsically prone to carrying recessive harmful mutations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Jay","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Chouteau","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Whibley","given":"Annabel"},{"family":"Bastide","given":"Héloïse"},{"family":"Parrinello","given":"Hugues"},{"family":"Llaurens","given":"Violaine"},{"family":"Joron","given":"Mathieu"}],"container-title":"Nature Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-020-00771-1","ISSN":"1546-1718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,25]]},"language":"en","page":"1-6","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Mutation load at a mimicry supergene sheds new light on the evolution of inversion polymorphisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-00771-1"},

Owing to pervasive genomic structural variation, a single reference genome assembly cannot capture the full complement of sequence diversity of a crop species (known as the ‘pan-genome’1). Multiple high-quality sequence assemblies are an indispensable component of a pan-genome infrastructure. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is an important cereal crop with a long history of cultivation that is adapted to a wide range of agro-climatic conditions2. Here we report the construction of chromosome-scale sequence assemblies for the genotypes of 20 varieties of barley—comprising landraces, cultivars and a wild barley—that were selected as representatives of global barley diversity. We catalogued genomic presence/absence variants and explored the use of structural variants for quantitative genetic analysis through whole-genome shotgun sequencing of 300 gene bank accessions. We discovered abundant large inversion polymorphisms and analysed in detail two inversions that are frequently found in current elite barley germplasm; one is probably the product of mutation breeding and the other is tightly linked to a locus that is involved in the expansion of geographical range. This first-generation barley pan-genome makes previously hidden genetic variation accessible to genetic studies and breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Jayakodi","given":"Murukarthick"},{"family":"Padmarasu","given":"Sudharsan"},{"family":"Haberer","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Bonthala","given":"Venkata Suresh"},{"family":"Gundlach","given":"Heidrun"},{"family":"Monat","given":"Cécile"},{"family":"Lux","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Kamal","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Himmelbach","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Ens","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiao-Qi"},{"family":"Angessa","given":"Tefera T."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Gaofeng"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Camilla"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Penghao"},{"family":"Schreiber","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Boston","given":"Lori B."},{"family":"Plott","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Jerry"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Fiebig","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Budak","given":"Hikmet"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Dongdong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chunchao"},{"family":"Grimwood","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Schmutz","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Ganggang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guoping"},{"family":"Mochida","given":"Keiichi"},{"family":"Hirayama","given":"Takashi"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Kazuhiro"},{"family":"Chalmers","given":"Kenneth J."},{"family":"Langridge","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Waugh","given":"Robbie"},{"family":"Pozniak","given":"Curtis J."},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Klaus F.

  {"id":"jia2014","abstract":"Improving yield is a major objective for cotton breeding schemes, and lint yield and its three component traits (boll number, boll weight and lint percentage) are complex traits controlled by multiple genes and various environments. Association mapping was performed to detect markers associated with these four traits using 651 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). A mixed linear model including epistasis and environmental interaction was used to screen the loci associated with these four yield traits by 323 accessions of Gossypium hirsutum L. evaluated in nine different environments. 251 significant loci were detected to be associated with lint yield and its three components, including 69 loci with individual effects and all involved in epistasis interactions. These significant loci explain ∼ 62.05% of the phenotypic variance (ranging from 49.06% ∼ 72.29% for these four traits). It was indicated by high contribution of environmental interaction to the phenotypic variance for lint yield and boll numbers, that genetic effects of SSR loci were susceptible to environment factors. Shared loci were also observed among these four traits, which may be used for simultaneous improvement in cotton breeding for yield traits. Furthermore, consistent and elite loci were screened with −Log10 (P-value) >8.0 based on predicted effects of loci detected in different environments. There was one locus and 6 pairs of epistasis for lint yield, 4 loci and 10 epistasis for boll number, 15 loci and 2 epistasis for boll weight, and 2 loci and 5 epistasis for lint percentage, respectively. These results provided insights into the genetic basis of lint yield and its components and may be useful for marker-assisted breeding to improve cotton production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Jia","given":"Yinhua"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Xiwei"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Junling"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Zhaoe"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiwen"},{"family":"He","given":"Shoupu"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Songhua"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Weijun"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Zhongli"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Baoyin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Liru"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jianguang"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Du","given":"Xiongming"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jun"}],"container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0095882","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,8]]},"language":"en","page":"e95882","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Association Mapping for Epistasis and Environmental Interaction of Yield Traits in 323 Cotton Cultivars under 9 Different Environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095882","volume":"9"},

However, the process by which the acquired immune systems adapts lipid metabolism to meet demands, and whether or not the metabolic rewiring confers a selective advantage to host immunity, remains unclear. Here we show that viral infection attenuates the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in murine CD4+ T cells, which in turn increases the expression of antiviral genes. Inhibition of the fatty acid synthesis pathway substantially increases the basal expression of antiviral genes via the spontaneous production of type I interferon (IFN). Using a combination of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technology and a global lipidomics analysis, we found that the decrease in monounsaturated fatty acid caused by genetic deletion of Scd2 in mice was crucial for the induction of an antiviral response through activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. These findings demonstrate the important relationship between fatty acid biosynthesis and type I IFN responses that enhances the antiviral response.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kanno","given":"Toshio"},{"family":"Nakajima","given":"Takahiro"},{"family":"Yokoyama","given":"Satoru"},{"family":"Asou","given":"Hikari K."},{"family":"Sasamoto","given":"Shigemi"},{"family":"Kamii","given":"Yasuhiro"},{"family":"Hayashizaki","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Ouchi","given":"Yasuo"},{"family":"Onodera","given":"Taishi"},{"family":"Takahashi","given":"Yoshimasa"},{"family":"Ikeda","given":"Kazutaka"},{"family":"Hasegawa","given":"Yoshinori"},{"family":"Kinjo","given":"Yuki"},{"family":"Ohara","given":"Osamu"},{"family":"Nakayama","given":"Toshinori"},{"family":"Endo","given":"Yusuke"}],"container-title":"Communications Biology","container-title-short":"Commun Biol","DOI":"10.1038/s42003-021-02310-y","ISSN":"2399-3642","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,29]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Antimicrobial responses;Interferons;T-helper 1 cells;Viral host response\nSubject_term_id: antimicrobial-responses;interferons;t-helper-1-cells;viral-host-response","number":"1","page":"1-14","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"SCD2-mediated monounsaturated fatty acid metabolism regulates cGAS-STING-dependent type I IFN responses in CD4+ T cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02310-y","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"kautt2020","abstract":"The transition from ‘well-marked varieties’ of a single species into ‘well-defined species’—especially in the absence of geographic barriers to gene flow (sympatric speciation)—has puzzled evolutionary biologists ever since Darwin1,2. Gene flow counteracts the buildup of genome-wide differentiation, which is a hallmark of speciation and increases the likelihood of the evolution of irreversible reproductive barriers (incompatibilities) that complete the speciation process3. Theory predicts that the genetic architecture of divergently selected traits can influence whether sympatric speciation occurs4, but empirical tests of this theory are scant because comprehensive data are difficult to collect and synthesize across species, owing to their unique biologies and evolutionary histories5. Here, within a young species complex of neotropical cichlid fishes (Amphilophus spp.), we analysed genomic divergence among populations and species. By generating a new genome assembly and re-sequencing 453 genomes, we uncovered the genetic architecture of traits that have been suggested to be important for divergence. Species that differ in monogenic or oligogenic traits that affect ecological performance and/or mate choice show remarkably localized genomic differentiation. By contrast, differentiation among species that have diverged in polygenic traits is genomically widespread and much higher overall, consistent with the evolution of effective and stable genome-wide barriers to gene flow. Thus, we conclude that simple trait architectures are not always as conducive to speciation with gene flow as previously suggested, whereas polygenic architectures can promote rapid and stable speciation in sympatry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kautt","given":"Andreas F."},{"family":"Kratochwil","given":"Claudius F."},{"family":"Nater","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Machado-Schiaffino","given":"Gonzalo"},{"family":"Olave","given":"Melisa"},{"family":"Henning","given":"Frederico"},{"family":"Torres-Dowdall","given":"Julián"},{"family":"Härer","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Hulsey","given":"C.

The nature and consequences of this variation are discussed based on additional genetic parameters, such as heritability and transgression and by examining the genomic position of eQTLs versus gene position, polymorphism frequency, and gene ontology. Furthermore, we developed an approach for genetic regulatory network construction by combining eQTL mapping and regulator candidate gene selection. The power of our method was shown in a case study of genes associated with flowering time, a well studied regulatory network in Arabidopsis. Results that revealed clusters of coregulated genes and their most likely regulators were in agreement with published data, and unknown relationships could be predicted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Keurentjes","given":"Joost J.

  {"id":"khodabandelou2019","abstract":"<h3>ABSTRACT</h3> <p>Deep neural network application is today a skyrocketing field in many disciplinary domains. In genomics the development of deep neural networks is expected to revolutionize current practice. Several approaches relying on convolutional neural networks have been developed to associate short genomic sequences with a functional role such as promoters, enhancers or protein binding sites along genomes. These approaches rely on the generation of sequences batches with known annotations for learning purpose. While they show good performance to predict annotations from a test subset of these batches, they usually perform poorly when applied genome-wide.</p><p>In this study, we address this issue and propose an optimal strategy to train convolutional neural networks for this specific application. We use as a case study transcription start sites and show that a model trained on one organism can be used to predict transcription start sites in a different specie. This cross-species application of convolutional neural networks trained with genomic sequence data provides a new technique to annotate any genome from previously existing annotations in related species. It also provides a way to determine whether the sequence patterns recognized by chromatin associated proteins in different species are conserved or not.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Khodabandelou","given":"Ghazaleh"},{"family":"Routhier","given":"Etienne"},{"family":"Mozziconacci","given":"Julien"}],"container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/330308","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,7]]},"language":"en","page":"330308","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","section":"New Results","source":"www.biorxiv.org","title":"Genome Functional Annotation across Species using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/330308v4"},

Big-LD uses an agglomerative approach that starts by identifying small communities of SNPs, i.e. the SNPs in each LD bin region, and proceeds by merging these communities. We determine the number of blocks using a method to find maximum-weight independent set.

In addition to the canonical genomic and 9 subgenomic RNAs, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further ﬁnd at least 41 RNA modiﬁcation sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif, AAGAA. Modiﬁed RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodiﬁed RNAs, suggesting a link between the modiﬁcation and the 30 tail.

Experimental methods to capture these interactions, such as chromosome conformation capture, usually cannot assign causal direction of effect between regulatory elements, an important component of fine-mapping studies. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical approach that uses two-stage least squares and applied it to an ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) data set from 100 individuals, to identify over 15,000 high-confidence causal interactions. Most (60%) interactions occurred over <20 kb, where chromosome conformation capture-based methods perform poorly. For a fraction of loci, we identified a single variant that alters accessibility across multiple regions, and experimentally validated the BLK locus, which is associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, using CRISPR genome editing.

  {"id":"lamberto2010","abstract":"S-allantoin, a major ureide compound, is produced in plant peroxisomes from oxidized purines. Sequence evidence suggested that the Transthyretin-like (TTL) protein, which interacts with brassinosteroid receptors, may act as a bifunctional enzyme in the synthesis of S-allantoin. Here, we show that recombinant TTL from Arabidopsis thaliana catalyzes two enzymatic reactions leading to the stereoselective formation of S-allantoin, hydrolysis of hydroxyisourate through a C-terminal Urah domain, and decarboxylation of 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline through an N-terminal Urad domain. We found that two different mRNAs are produced from the TTL gene through alternative use of two splice acceptor sites. The corresponding proteins differ in the presence (TTL1−) and the absence (TTL2−) of a rare internal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2). The two proteins have similar catalytic activity in vitro but different in vivo localization: TTL1− localizes in peroxisomes, whereas TTL2− localizes in the cytosol. Similar splice variants are present in monocots and dicots. TTL originated in green algae through a Urad-Urah fusion, which entrapped an N-terminal PTS2 between the two domains. The presence of this gene in all Viridiplantae indicates that S-allantoin biosynthesis has general significance in plant nitrogen metabolism, while conservation of alternative splicing suggests that this mechanism has general implications in the regulation of the ureide pathway in flowering plants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Lamberto","given":"Ilaria"},{"family":"Percudani","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Gatti","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Folli","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Petrucco","given":"Stefania"}],"container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"The Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1105/tpc.109.070102","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,5,1]]},"page":"1564-1574","source":"Silverchair","title":"Conserved Alternative Splicing of Arabidopsis Transthyretin-Like Determines Protein Localization and S-Allantoin Synthesis in Peroxisomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.109.070102","volume":"22"},

The wild-type and mutant segmentation patterns are consistent with an antero-posterior gradient in repressor concentration along the embryo and a proximo-distal gradient along the chromosome in the affinities for repressor of each gene's cis-regulatory element.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Lewis","given":"E.

  {"id":"li2007","abstract":"Composite interval mapping (CIM) is the most commonly used method for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) with populations derived from biparental crosses. However, the algorithm implemented in the popular QTL Cartographer software may not completely ensure all its advantageous properties. In addition, different background marker selection methods may give very different mapping results, and the nature of the preferred method is not clear. A modiﬁed algorithm called inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) is proposed in this article. In ICIM, marker selection is conducted only once through stepwise regression by considering all marker information simultaneously, and the phenotypic values are then adjusted by all markers retained in the regression equation except the two markers ﬂanking the current mapping interval. The adjusted phenotypic values are ﬁnally used in interval mapping (IM). The modiﬁed algorithm has a simpler form than that used in CIM, but a faster convergence speed. ICIM retains all advantages of CIM over IM and avoids the possible increase of sampling variance and the complicated background marker selection process in CIM. Extensive simulations using two genomes and various genetic models indicated that ICIM has increased detection power, a reduced false detection rate, and less biased estimates of QTL effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Huihui"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Guoyou"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiankang"}],"container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.106.066811","ISSN":"0016-6731, 1943-2631","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,1]]},"language":"en","page":"361-374","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Modified Algorithm for the Improvement of Composite Interval Mapping","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/175/1/361-374/6062043","volume":"175"},

  {"id":"li2017","abstract":"Rice feeds half the world’s population, and rice blast is often a destructive disease that results in significant crop loss. Non-race-specific resistance has been more effective in controlling crop diseases than race-specific resistance because of its broad spectrum and durability. Through a genome-wide association study, we report the identification of a natural allele of a C2H2-type transcription factor in rice that confers non-race-specific resistance to blast. A survey of 3,000 sequenced rice genomes reveals that this allele exists in 10% of rice, suggesting that this favorable trait has been selected through breeding. This allele causes a single nucleotide change in the promoter of the bsr-d1 gene, which results in reduced expression of the gene through the binding of the repressive MYB transcription factor and, consequently, an inhibition of H2O2 degradation and enhanced disease resistance. Our discovery highlights this novel allele as a strategy for breeding durable resistance in rice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Weitao"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Ziwei"},{"family":"Chern","given":"Mawsheng"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Junjie"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Ran","given":"Li"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Mengping"},{"family":"He","given":"Min"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Kang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiaogang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xiaobo"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhixiong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jichun"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Wen"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Bingtian"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Weilan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuping"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jiali"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wenming"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xianjun"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jirui"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Lihuang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shigui"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xuewei"}],"container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2017.06.008","ISSN":"0092-8674","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,29]]},"language":"en","page":"114-126.e15","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A Natural Allele of a Transcription Factor in Rice Confers Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867417306499","volume":"170"},

We find that co-expression of BIA genes increases within clusters and identify candidates with unknown function based on clustering and covariation in expression and alkaloid production. Copy number variation in critical BIA genes correlates with stark differences in alkaloid production, linking noscapine production with an 11-gene deletion, and increased thebaine/decreased morphine production with deletion of a T6ODM cluster.

  {"id":"libbrecht2015","abstract":"The field of machine learning includes the development and application of computer algorithms that improve with experience.Machine learning methods can be divided into supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods are trained on examples with labels (for example, 'gene' or 'not gene') and are then used to predict these labels on other examples, whereas unsupervised methods find patterns in data sets without the use of labels. Semi-supervised methods combine these two approaches, leveraging patterns in unlabelled data to improve power in the prediction of labels.Different machine learning methods may be required for an application, depending on whether one is interested in interpreting the output model or is simply concerned with predictive power. Generative models, which posit a probabilistic distribution over input data, are generally best for interpretability, whereas discriminative models, which seek only to model labels, are generally best for predictive power.Prior information can be added to a model in order to train the model more effectively when it is provided with limited data, to limit the complexity of the model or to incorporate data that are not used by the model directly. Prior information can be incorporated explicitly in a probabilistic model or implicitly through the choice of features or similarity measures.The choice of an appropriate performance measure depends strongly on the application task. Machine learning methods are most effective when they optimize an appropriate performance measure.Network estimation methods are appropriate when the data contain complex dependencies among examples. These methods work best when they take into account the confounding effects of indirect relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Libbrecht","given":"Maxwell W."},{"family":"Noble","given":"William Stafford"}],"container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/nrg3920","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6]]},"language":"en","number":"6","page":"321-332","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Machine learning applications in genetics and genomics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3920","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"lisch2013","abstract":"Transposable elements (TEs) are the single most variable components of plant genomes. Even closely related plants can harbour widely different populations of TEs.TEs can cause a broad array of changes in gene composition and function. These changes range from simple insertional mutations to genetic reprogramming, gene movement and the evolution of novel functional protein-coding sequences.To restrain TE activity, plants have a potent response that results in epigenetic silencing of these elements. This can in turn result in epigenetic as well as genetic variation in plant gene function.The changes caused by TEs are a potentially rich source of variation on which selection can operate. Given the large numbers of plant TEs on evidence for ongoing activity of these selfish genetic elements, it is a reasonable hypothesis that TEs have played an important part in plant adaptation.Despite the possibilities raised by experimental evidence of the kinds of changes that TEs can cause, there is only limited and anecdotal evidence that TEs have in fact been important players in adaptive evolution of plants.Recent advances in genomics and phenomics have made it possible systematically to assess the part that TEs have played. It is only through the systematic identification of large numbers of alleles with important effects on phenotype that it will be possible to determine the relative role that TEs have had in the generation of meaningful genetic variation in plants.Domesticated plant species provide us with an ideal model for understanding this process. These species have been under strong, recent directional selection, often have well-characterized TEs, have been extensively characterized with respect to trait variation and can be readily compared to wild relatives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Lisch","given":"Damon"}],"container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/nrg3374","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"49-61","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"How important are transposons for plant evolution?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3374","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"liu2017","abstract":"A detailed understanding of genetic architecture of mRNA expression by millions of genetic variants is important for studying quantitative trait variation. In this study, we identiﬁed 1.25M SNPs with a minor allele frequency greater than 0.05 by combining reduced genome sequencing (GBS), highdensity array technologies (600K), and previous deep RNA-sequencing data from 368 diverse inbred lines of maize. The balanced allelic frequencies and distributions in a relatively large and diverse natural panel helped to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) associated with more than 18 000 genes (63.4% of tested genes). We found that distant eQTLs were more frequent ($75% of all eQTLs) across the whole genome. Thirteen novel associated loci affecting maize kernel oil concentration were identiﬁed using the new dataset, among which one intergenic locus affected the kernel oil variation by controlling expression of three other known oil-related genes. Altogether, this study provides resources for expanding our understanding of cellular regulatory mechanisms of transcriptome variation and the landscape of functional variants within the maize genome, thereby enhancing the understanding of quantitative variations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Haijun"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Niu","given":"Luyao"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Yingjie"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaqing"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Minliang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenqiang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jianbing"}],"container-title":"Molecular Plant","container-title-short":"Molecular Plant","DOI":"10.1016/j.molp.2016.06.016","ISSN":"16742052","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3]]},"language":"en","page":"414-426","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Distant eQTLs and Non-coding Sequences Play Critical Roles in Regulating Gene Expression and Quantitative Trait Variation in Maize","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1674205216301290","volume":"10"},

Beyond the many 'hits' obtained, this review summarizes recent efforts to increase our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits by focusing on non-main effects including epistasis, pleiotropy, and phenotypic plasticity. We also discuss how these achievements and the remaining gaps in our knowledge will guide future studies.

  {"id":"liu2019a","abstract":"Early genome-wide association studies (GWASs) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, most of the heritability is due to huge numbers of common variants with tiny effect sizes. Previously, we argued that new models are needed to understand these patterns. Here, we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits are partitioned into direct effects from core genes and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting in trans. We propose that most heritability is driven by weak trans-eQTL SNPs, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak trans effects. Thus, our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Xuanyao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yang I."},{"family":"Pritchard","given":"Jonathan K."}],"container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014","ISSN":"0092-8674","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1022-1034.e6","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Trans Effects on Gene Expression Can Drive Omnigenic Inheritance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419304003","volume":"177"},

Identification of the regulatory variants controlling the gene expression in response to drought, a major environmental threat of crop production worldwide, is of great value for drought-tolerant gene identification.\nResults: A total of 627 RNA-seq analyses are performed for 224 maize accessions which represent a wide genetic diversity under three water regimes; 73,573 eQTLs are detected for about 30,000 expressing genes with high-density genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms, reflecting a comprehensive and dynamic genetic architecture of gene expression in response to drought. The regulatory variants controlling the gene expression constitutively or drought-dynamically are unraveled. Focusing on dynamic regulatory variants resolved to genes encoding transcription factors, a drought-responsive network reflecting a hierarchy of transcription factors and their target genes is built. Moreover, 97 genes are prioritized to associate with drought tolerance due to their expression variations through the Mendelian randomization analysis. One of the candidate genes, Abscisic acid 8′-hydroxylase, is verified to play a negative role in plant drought tolerance.\nConclusions: This study unravels the effects of genetic variants on gene expression dynamics in drought response which allows us to better understand the role of distal and proximal genetic effects on gene expression and phenotypic plasticity. The prioritized drought-associated genes may serve as direct targets for functional investigation or allelic mining.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Shengxue"},{"family":"Li","given":"Cuiping"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hongwei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shuhui"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Shiping"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaohu"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jianbing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Bailin"},{"family":"Beatty","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Zastrow-Hayes","given":"Gina"},{"family":"Song","given":"Shuhui"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Feng"}],"container-title":"Genome Biology","container-title-short":"Genome Biol","DOI":"10.1186/s13059-020-02069-1","ISSN":"1474-760X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"language":"en","page":"163","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mapping regulatory variants controlling gene expression in drought response and tolerance in maize","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02069-1","volume":"21"},

Analysis of 13 T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias identified a recurrent intronic variant predicted to cis-activate the TAL1 oncogene, a finding validated in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing of a patient-derived xenograft. Candidate oncogenes include the prolactin receptor PRLR activated by a focal deletion that removes a CTCF-insulated neighborhood boundary. cis-X may be applied to pediatric and adult solid tumors that are aneuploid and heterogeneous.

  {"id":"liu2020d","abstract":"Maize (Zea mays) is one of the most important crops in the world. However, few agronomically important maize genes have been cloned and used for trait improvement, due to its complex genome and genetic architecture. Here, we integrated multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9-based high-throughput targeted mutagenesis with genetic mapping and genomic approaches to successfully target 743 candidate genes corresponding to traits relevant for agronomy and nutrition. After low-cost barcode-based deep sequencing, 412 edited sequences covering 118 genes were precisely identified from individuals showing clear phenotypic changes. The profiles of the associated gene-editing events were similar to those identified in human cell lines and consequently are predictable using an existing algorithm originally designed for human studies. We observed unexpected but frequent homology-directed repair through endogenous templates that was likely caused by spatial contact between distinct chromosomes. Based on the characterization and interpretation of gene function from several examples, we demonstrate that the integration of forward and reverse genetics via a targeted mutagenesis library promises rapid validation of important agronomic genes for crops with complex genomes. Beyond specific findings, this study also guides further optimization of high-throughput CRISPR experiments in plants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Hai-Jun"},{"family":"Jian","given":"Liumei"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Jieting"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Maolin"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Minliang"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jiali"},{"family":"Han","given":"Baozhu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Fan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiangguo"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Wenjie"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Yunxiu"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiaofeng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhenxian"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Mingliang"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Jiamin"},{"family":"Bai","given":"Minji"},{"family":"Song","given":"Wenhao"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Hanmo"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Xi’ang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenqiang"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Yuming"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ya"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Jiuran"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Yangwen"},{"family":"Jackson","given":"David"},{"family":"Fernie","given":"Alisdair R."},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jianbing"}],"container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"The Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1105/tpc.19.00934","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,1]]},"page":"1397-1413","source":"Silverchair","title":"High-Throughput CRISPR/Cas9 Mutagenesis Streamlines Trait Gene Identification in Maize[OPEN]","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.19.00934","volume":"32"},

Exploring genetic architecture underlying plant plasticity variation may help mitigate the detrimental effects of a rapidly changing climate on agriculture, but little research has been done in this area to date. In the present study, we established a population of 976 maize F1 hybrids by crossing 488 diverse inbred lines with two elite testers. Genome-wide association study identified hundreds of quantitative trait loci associated with phenotypic plasticity variation across diverse F1 hybrids, the majority of which contributed very little variance, in accordance with the polygenic nature of these traits. We identified several quantitative trait locus regions that may have been selected during the tropical-temperate adaptation process. We also observed heterosis in terms of phenotypic plasticity, in addition to the traditional genetic value differences measured between hybrid and inbred lines, and the pattern of which was affected by genetic background. Our results demonstrate a landscape of phenotypic plasticity in maize, which will aid in the understanding of its genetic architecture, its contribution to adaptation and heterosis, and how it may be exploited for future maize breeding in a rapidly changing environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Nannan"},{"family":"Du","given":"Yuanhao"},{"family":"Warburton","given":"Marilyn L"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Yingjie"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jianbing"}],"container-title":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","DOI":"10.1093/molbev/msaa283","editor":[{"family":"Michael","given":"Purugganan"}],"ISSN":"0737-4038, 1537-1719","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,3]]},"language":"en","page":"msaa283","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Phenotypic Plasticity Contributes to Maize Adaptation and Heterosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/molbev/msaa283/5952686"},

  {"id":"liu2021a","abstract":"The intensive application of inorganic nitrogen underlies marked increases in crop production, but imposes detrimental effects on ecosystems1,2: it is therefore crucial for future sustainable agriculture to improve the nitrogen-use efficiency of crop plants. Here we report the genetic basis of nitrogen-use efficiency associated with adaptation to local soils in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Using a panel of diverse rice germplasm collected from different ecogeographical regions, we performed a genome-wide association study on the tillering response to nitrogen—the trait that is most closely correlated with nitrogen-use efficiency in rice—and identified OsTCP19 as a modulator of this tillering response through its transcriptional response to nitrogen and its targeting to the tiller-promoting gene DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (DLT)3,4. A 29-bp insertion and/or deletion in the OsTCP19 promoter confers a differential transcriptional response and variation in the tillering response to nitrogen among rice varieties. The allele of OsTCP19 associated with a high tillering response to nitrogen is prevalent in wild rice populations, but has largely been lost in modern cultivars: this loss correlates with increased local soil nitrogen content, which suggests that it might have contributed to geographical adaptation in rice. Introgression of the allele associated with a high tillering response into modern rice cultivars boosts grain yield and nitrogen-use efficiency under low or moderate levels of nitrogen, which demonstrates substantial potential for rice breeding and the amelioration of negative environment effects by reducing the application of nitrogen to crops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Yongqiang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hongru"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Zhimin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Ruineng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Qihui"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhihua"},{"family":"Li","given":"Aifu"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Ou","given":"Shujun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiujie"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Shouyun"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Hongning"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yonghong"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Chengcai"}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-03091-w","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7847","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","number":"7847","page":"600-605","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Genomic basis of geographical adaptation to soil nitrogen in rice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03091-w","volume":"590"},

Analysis of biomass and survival among 732 resequenced genotypes, which were grown across 10 common gardens that span 1,800 km of latitude, jointly revealed extensive genomic evidence of climate adaptation. Climate–gene–biomass associations were abundant but varied considerably among deeply diverged gene pools. Furthermore, we found that gene flow accelerated climate adaptation during the postglacial colonization of northern habitats through introgression of alleles from a pre-adapted northern gene pool. The polyploid nature of switchgrass also enhanced adaptive potential through the fractionation of gene function, as there was an increased level of heritable genetic diversity on the nondominant subgenome. In addition to investigating patterns of climate adaptation, the genome resources and gene–trait associations developed here provide breeders with the necessary tools to increase switchgrass yield for the sustainable production of bioenergy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lovell","given":"John T."},{"family":"MacQueen","given":"Alice H."},{"family":"Mamidi","given":"Sujan"},{"family":"Bonnette","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Jerry"},{"family":"Napier","given":"Joseph D."},{"family":"Sreedasyam","given":"Avinash"},{"family":"Healey","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Session","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Shu","given":"Shengqiang"},{"family":"Barry","given":"Kerrie"},{"family":"Bonos","given":"Stacy"},{"family":"Boston","given":"LoriBeth"},{"family":"Daum","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Deshpande","given":"Shweta"},{"family":"Ewing","given":"Aren"},{"family":"Grabowski","given":"Paul P."},{"family":"Haque","given":"Taslima"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Jiming"},{"family":"Kudrna","given":"Dave"},{"family":"Lipzen","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Pendergast","given":"Thomas H."},{"family":"Plott","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Saski","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Shakirov","given":"Eugene V."},{"family":"Sims","given":"David"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Manoj"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Ada"},{"family":"Singan","given":"Vasanth R."},{"family":"Tang","given":"Yuhong"},{"family":"Thibivillier","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Webber","given":"Jenell"},{"family":"Weng","given":"Xiaoyu"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Guohong Albert"},{"family":"Yoshinaga","given":"Yuko"},{"family":"Zane","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Li"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jiyi"},{"family":"Behrman","given":"Kathrine D."},{"family":"Boe","given":"Arvid R."},{"family":"Fay","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Fritschi","given":"Felix B."},{"family":"Jastrow","given":"Julie D."},{"family":"Lloyd-Reilley","given":"John"},{"family":"Martínez-Reyna","given":"Juan Manuel"},{"family":"Matamala","given":"Roser"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Robert B."},{"family":"Rouquette","given":"Francis M."},{"family":"Ronald","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Saha","given":"Malay"},{"family":"Tobias","given":"Christian M."},{"family":"Udvardi","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wing","given":"Rod A."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yanqi"},{"family":"Bartley","given":"Laura E."},{"family":"Casler","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Devos","given":"Katrien M."},{"family":"Lowry","given":"David B."},{"family":"Rokhsar","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Grimwood","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Juenger","given":"Thomas E."},{"family":"Schmutz","given":"Jeremy"}],"container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-03127-1","ISSN":"0028-0836, 1476-4687","issue":"7846","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,18]]},"language":"en","page":"438-444","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Genomic mechanisms of climate adaptation in polyploid bioenergy switchgrass","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03127-1","volume":"590"},

The genetic regulation of high temperature (HT) response in the major crop cotton is poorly understood. We determined the functionality and transcriptomes of anther of 218 cotton accessions grown under HT stress. By analyzing transcriptome divergence and implementing genome-wide association study (GWAS), we identified three thermal tolerance associated loci which contained 75 protein coding genes and 27 long non-coding RNAs, and provided expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for 13,132 transcripts. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) confirmed six causal elements for the HT response (three genes overlapped with GWAS results), involved in protein kinase activity. The most susceptible gene, GhHRK1 was confirmed as a previously uncharacterized negative regulator of the HT response both in cotton and in Arabidopsis. These functional variants provided new understanding of genetic basis for HT tolerance in male reproduction organs.","author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Yizan"},{"family":"Min","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Junduo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yaoyao"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yuanlong"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Yuanhao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Maojun"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yajun"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Zhaolong"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Sai"},{"family":"Su","given":"Xiaojun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chaozhi"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yunlong"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Qidi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yanlong"},{"family":"Chi","given":"Huabin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Miao"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Aamir Hamid"},{"family":"Lindsey","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Longfu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xueyuan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xianlong"}],"container-title":"The New Phytologist","container-title-short":"New Phytol","DOI":"10.1111/nph.17325","ISSN":"1469-8137","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,4]]},"language":"eng","PMID":"33665819","source":"PubMed","title":"Combined transcriptome GWAS and TWAS reveal genetic elements leading to male sterility during high temperature stress in cotton","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"ma2021a","abstract":"Cotton produces natural fiber for the textile industry. The genetic effects of genomic structural variations underlying agronomic traits remain unclear. Here, we generate two high-quality genomes of Gossypium hirsutum cv. NDM8 and Gossypium barbadense acc. Pima90, and identify large-scale structural variations in the two species and 1,081 G. hirsutum accessions. The density of structural variations is higher in the D-subgenome than in the A-subgenome, indicating that the D-subgenome undergoes stronger selection during species formation and variety development. Many structural variations in genes and/or regulatory regions potentially influencing agronomic traits were discovered. Of 446 significantly associated structural variations, those for fiber quality and Verticillium wilt resistance are located mainly in the D-subgenome and those for yield mainly in the A-subgenome. Our research provides insight into the role of structural variations in genotype-to-phenotype relationships and their potential utility in crop improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Zhiying"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Liqiang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guiyin"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Zhengwen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhikun"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Yafei"},{"family":"Ke","given":"Huifeng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhengwen"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Qishen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhicheng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Guoning"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jinhua"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Yuanyuan"},{"family":"Meng","given":"Chengsheng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Lihua"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiuxin"},{"family":"Mo","given":"Shaojing"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Limei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Liting"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Man"},{"family":"Si","given":"Aijun"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhanwu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Lizhu"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Dongmei"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Yanru"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Lv","given":"Xing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Rongkang"},{"family":"Duan","given":"Yihong"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Shilin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xingfen"}],"container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00910-2","ISSN":"1546-1718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,9]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: DNA sequencing;Genome-wide association studies;Sequence annotation\nSubject_term_id: dna-sequencing;genome-wide-association-studies;sequence-annotation","page":"1-7","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"High-quality genome assembly and resequencing of modern cotton cultivars provide resources for crop improvement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00910-2"},

  {"id":"mackay2009","abstract":"Most phenotypic variation in natural populations is attributable to multiple interacting loci, with allelic effects that are sensitive to the exact environmental conditions each individual experiences. The underlying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) can be mapped by linkage to polymorphic marker loci with clear Mendelian segregation such as molecular polymorphisms.QTLs can be mapped in families or segregating progeny of crosses between genetically divergent strains (linkage mapping) or in unrelated individuals from the same population (association mapping). In both cases, large numbers of individuals are needed to detect and localize QTLs; the number of individuals and genotypes per individual needed increases as the QTL effect size decreases and the precision of localization increases.Positional cloning is the gold standard of identifying genes that correspond to QTLs. Corroborating evidence that a gene causes the variation in the trait of interest includes replication in independent studies, identifying potentially functional DNA polymorphisms between alternative alleles of one of the candidate genes, showing a difference in mRNA expression levels between genotypes, showing that mRNA or protein is expressed in tissues that are thought to be relevant to the trait, and showing that mutations in candidate genes affect the trait or fail to complement QTL alleles.Results of QTL mapping efforts in many species over the past 20 years have showed that there are key common features of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits: many loci with small effects are responsible for most quantitative genetic variation, these loci are often unexpected based on prior knowledge of the trait or correspond to computationally predicted genes; the effects of QTL alleles are highly context-dependent and vary depending on genetic background, environment and sex; and pleiotropic QTL effects are widespread.Despite 20 years of intensive effort, we have fallen short of our long-term goal of explaining genetic variation for quantitative traits in terms of the underlying genes, the effects of segregating alleles in different genetic backgrounds and in a range of ecologically relevant environments, as well as their effects on other traits, the molecular basis of functional allelic effects and the population frequency of causal variants. The challenge of dissecting quantitative traits into individual genes and their causal molecular polymorphisms will be solved in the near future by applying new sequencing and genotyping technologies to the problem, in combination with new community resources.Understanding the biological context in which molecular polymorphisms elicit their effects on trait variation requires knowledge of the effects of the polymorphisms on complex networks of transcriptional, protein, metabolic and other molecular endophenotypes that lead to the organismal phenotype. This is the province of the emerging discipline of systems genetics.Systems genetics integrates DNA sequence variation, variation in transcript abundance and other molecular phenotypes, and variation in organismal phenotypes in a linkage or association mapping population and enables us to interpret quantitative genetic variation in terms of biologically meaningful causal networks of correlated transcripts. The association of molecular variation with organismal phenotypes identifies QTLs, the association of molecular variation with gene expression traits identifies expression QTLs and correlations between gene expression and organismal level phenotypes identify quantitative trait transcripts.Levels of expression of many transcripts covary between individuals in a mapping population; the correlated transcripts can be grouped statistically into modules, in which each module consists of transcripts with higher correlations to each other than to the rest of the transcriptome. The correlations between transcripts in a module can be visualized graphically as a network with nodes denoting transcripts and edges connecting nodes that are genetically correlated. Causal biological networks can be derived from coexpression transcriptional networks that are also correlated with the phenotype of an organism, using the statistical concept of conditional dependence. The statistical definition of the molecular interactions that govern phenotypic variation through natural genetic perturbations is a testable hypothesis that can be validated and refined by functional studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Mackay","given":"Trudy F.

  {"id":"mackay2014","abstract":"The role of epistasis in the genetic architecture of quantitative traits is controversial, despite the biological plausibility that nonlinear molecular interactions underpin the genotype–phenotype map. This controversy arises because most genetic variation for quantitative traits is additive. However, additive variance is consistent with pervasive epistasis. In this Review, I discuss experimental designs to detect the contribution of epistasis to quantitative trait phenotypes in model organisms. These studies indicate that epistasis is common, and that additivity can be an emergent property of underlying genetic interaction networks. Epistasis causes hidden quantitative genetic variation in natural populations and could be responsible for the small additive effects, missing heritability and the lack of replication that are typically observed for human complex traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Mackay","given":"Trudy F.

In the past, the application of expression microarray and genetic variation data to study populations enabled the rapid identification of eQTLs in model organisms and humans. Now, a new technology promises to revolutionize the field. Massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides unprecedented resolution, allowing us to accurately monitor not only the expression output of each genomic locus but also reconstruct and quantify alternatively spliced transcripts.

We introduce a probabilistic framework that models correlation among transcriptome-wide association study signals to assign a probability for every gene in the risk region to explain the observed association signal. Importantly, our approach remains accurate when expression data for causal genes are not available in the causal tissue by leveraging expression prediction from other tissues. Our approach yields credible sets of genes containing the causal gene at a nominal confidence level (for example, 90%) that can be used to prioritize genes for functional assays.

  {"id":"marcais2018","abstract":"The MUMmer system and the genome sequence aligner nucmer included within it are among the most widely used alignment packages in genomics. Since the last major release of MUMmer version 3 in 2004, it has been applied to many types of problems including aligning whole genome sequences, aligning reads to a reference genome, and comparing different assemblies of the same genome. Despite its broad utility, MUMmer3 has limitations that can make it difficult to use for large genomes and for the very large sequence data sets that are common today. In this paper we describe MUMmer4, a substantially improved version of MUMmer that addresses genome size constraints by changing the 32-bit suffix tree data structure at the core of MUMmer to a 48-bit suffix array, and that offers improved speed through parallel processing of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input size of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any biologically realistic length. We show that as a result of these enhancements, the nucmer program in MUMmer4 is easily able to handle alignments of large genomes; we illustrate this with an alignment of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which allows us to compute that the two species are 98% identical across 96% of their length. With the enhancements described here, MUMmer4 can also be used to efficiently align reads to reference genomes, although it is less sensitive and accurate than the dedicated read aligners. The nucmer aligner in MUMmer4 can now be called from scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby. These improvements make MUMer4 one the most versatile genome alignment packages available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Marçais","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Delcher","given":"Arthur L."},{"family":"Phillippy","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Coston","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Salzberg","given":"Steven L."},{"family":"Zimin","given":"Aleksey"}],"container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005944","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,26]]},"language":"en","page":"e1005944","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"MUMmer4: A fast and versatile genome alignment system","title-short":"MUMmer4","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005944","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"mcmullen2009","abstract":"Codifying Maize Modifications\nMaize, one of our most important crop species, has been the target of genetic investigation and experimentation for more than 100 years. Crossing two inbred lines tends to result in “better” offspring, in a process known as heterosis. Attempts to map the genetic loci that control traits important for farming have been made, but few have been successful (see the Perspective by Mackay). Buckler et al. (p. 714) and McMullen et al. (p. 737) produced a genomic map of maize that relates recombination to genome structure. Even tremendous adaptations in very diverse species were produced by numerous, small additive steps. Differences in flowering time in maize among inbred lines were not caused by a few genes with large effects, but by the cumulative effects of numerous quantitative trait loci—each of which has only a small impact on the trait.\nMaize genetic diversity has been used to understand the molecular basis of phenotypic variation and to improve agricultural efficiency and sustainability. We crossed 25 diverse inbred maize lines to the B73 reference line, capturing a total of 136,000 recombination events. Variation for recombination frequencies was observed among families, influenced by local (cis) genetic variation. We identified evidence for numerous minor single-locus effects but little two-locus linkage disequilibrium or segregation distortion, which indicated a limited role for genes with large effects and epistatic interactions on fitness. We observed excess residual heterozygosity in pericentromeric regions, which suggested that selection in inbred lines has been less efficient in these regions because of reduced recombination frequency.

The genomic sequence provides evidence for very low rates of heterozygosity in the Denisova, probably not because of recent inbreeding, but instead because of a small population size.

It also allows tentative dating of the specimen on the basis of “missing evolution” in its genome, detailed measurements of Denisovan and Neandertal admixture into present-day human populations, and the generation of a near-complete catalog of genetic changes that swept to high frequency in modern humans since their divergence from Denisovans.\nA close-up look provides clues to the relationships between modern humans, Denisovans, and Neandertals.\nA close-up look provides clues to the relationships between modern humans, Denisovans, and Neandertals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Kircher","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Gansauge","given":"Marie-Theres"},{"family":"Li","given":"Heng"},{"family":"Racimo","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Mallick","given":"Swapan"},{"family":"Schraiber","given":"Joshua G."},{"family":"Jay","given":"Flora"},{"family":"Prüfer","given":"Kay"},{"family":"Filippo","given":"Cesare","dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Sudmant","given":"Peter H."},{"family":"Alkan","given":"Can"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Qiaomei"},{"family":"Do","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Rohland","given":"Nadin"},{"family":"Tandon","given":"Arti"},{"family":"Siebauer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Green","given":"Richard E."},{"family":"Bryc","given":"Katarzyna"},{"family":"Briggs","given":"Adrian W."},{"family":"Stenzel","given":"Udo"},{"family":"Dabney","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Shendure","given":"Jay"},{"family":"Kitzman","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Hammer","given":"Michael F."},{"family":"Shunkov","given":"Michael V."},{"family":"Derevianko","given":"Anatoli P."},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Andrés","given":"Aida M."},{"family":"Eichler","given":"Evan E."},{"family":"Slatkin","given":"Montgomery"},{"family":"Reich","given":"David"},{"family":"Kelso","given":"Janet"},{"family":"Pääbo","given":"Svante"}],"container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1224344","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6104","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,10,12]]},"language":"en","page":"222-226","PMID":"22936568","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Article","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"A High-Coverage Genome Sequence from an Archaic Denisovan Individual","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6104/222","volume":"338"},
  {"id":"meyer2021","abstract":"Lungfishes belong to lobe-fined fish (Sarcopterygii) that, in the Devonian period, ‘conquered’ the land and ultimately gave rise to all land vertebrates, including humans1–3. Here we determine the chromosome-quality genome of the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), which is known to have the largest genome of any animal. The vast size of this genome, which is about 14× larger than that of humans, is attributable mostly to huge intergenic regions and introns with high repeat content (around 90%), the components of which resemble those of tetrapods (comprising mainly long interspersed nuclear elements) more than they do those of ray-finned fish. The lungfish genome continues to expand independently (its transposable elements are still active), through mechanisms different to those of the enormous genomes of salamanders. The 17 fully assembled lungfish macrochromosomes maintain synteny to other vertebrate chromosomes, and all microchromosomes maintain conserved ancient homology with the ancestral vertebrate karyotype. Our phylogenomic analyses confirm previous reports that lungfish occupy a key evolutionary position as the closest living relatives to tetrapods4,5, underscoring the importance of lungfish for understanding innovations associated with terrestrialization. Lungfish preadaptations to living on land include the gain of limb-like expression in developmental genes such as hoxc13 and sall1 in their lobed fins. Increased rates of evolution and the duplication of genes associated with obligate air-breathing, such as lung surfactants and the expansion of odorant receptor gene families (which encode proteins involved in detecting airborne odours), contribute to the tetrapod-like biology of lungfishes. These findings advance our understanding of this major transition during vertebrate evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Schloissnig","given":"Siegfried"},{"family":"Franchini","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Du","given":"Kang"},{"family":"Woltering","given":"Joost M."},{"family":"Irisarri","given":"Iker"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Wai Yee"},{"family":"Nowoshilow","given":"Sergej"},{"family":"Kneitz","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Kawaguchi","given":"Akane"},{"family":"Fabrizius","given":"Andrej"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Peiwen"},{"family":"Dechaud","given":"Corentin"},{"family":"Spaink","given":"Herman P."},{"family":"Volff","given":"Jean-Nicolas"},{"family":"Simakov","given":"Oleg"},{"family":"Burmester","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Elly M."},{"family":"Schartl","given":"Manfred"}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03198-8","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7845","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","number":"7845","page":"284-289","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Giant lungfish genome elucidates the conquest of land by vertebrates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03198-8","volume":"590"},

Using shared genetic control between distal DNAm sites, we constructed networks, identifying 405 discrete genomic communities enriched for genomic annotations and complex traits. Shared genetic variants are associated with both DNAm levels and complex diseases, but only in a minority of cases do these associations reflect causal relationships from DNAm to trait or vice versa, indicating a more complex genotype–phenotype map than previously anticipated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Min","given":"Josine L."},{"family":"Hemani","given":"Gibran"},{"family":"Hannon","given":"Eilis"},{"family":"Dekkers","given":"Koen F."},{"family":"Castillo-Fernandez","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Luijk","given":"René"},{"family":"Carnero-Montoro","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Lawson","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Burrows","given":"Kimberley"},{"family":"Suderman","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Bretherick","given":"Andrew D."},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Tom G."},{"family":"Klughammer","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Iotchkova","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Sharp","given":"Gemma"},{"family":"Al Khleifat","given":"Ahmad"},{"family":"Shatunov","given":"Aleksey"},{"family":"Iacoangeli","given":"Alfredo"},{"family":"McArdle","given":"Wendy L."},{"family":"Ho","given":"Karen M."},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Ashish"},{"family":"Söderhäll","given":"Cilla"},{"family":"Soriano-Tárraga","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Giralt-Steinhauer","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Kazmi","given":"Nabila"},{"family":"Mason","given":"Dan"},{"family":"McRae","given":"Allan F."},{"family":"Corcoran","given":"David L."},{"family":"Sugden","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Kasela","given":"Silva"},{"family":"Cardona","given":"Alexia"},{"family":"Day","given":"Felix R."},{"family":"Cugliari","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Viberti","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Guarrera","given":"Simonetta"},{"family":"Lerro","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Richa"},{"family":"Bollepalli","given":"Sailalitha"},{"family":"Mandaviya","given":"Pooja"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Yanni"},{"family":"Clarke","given":"Toni-Kim"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Rosie M."},{"family":"Schmoll","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Czamara","given":"Darina"},{"family":"Ruiz-Arenas","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Rezwan","given":"Faisal I."},{"family":"Marioni","given":"Riccardo E."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Tian"},{"family":"Awaloff","given":"Yvonne"},{"family":"Germain","given":"Marine"},{"family":"Aïssi","given":"Dylan"},{"family":"Zwamborn","given":"Ramona"},{"family":"Eijk","given":"Kristel","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Dekker","given":"Annelot"},{"family":"Dongen","given":"Jenny","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Hottenga","given":"Jouke-Jan"},{"family":"Willemsen","given":"Gonneke"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Cheng-Jian"},{"family":"Barturen","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Català-Moll","given":"Francesc"},{"family":"Kerick","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Melton","given":"Phillip"},{"family":"Elliott","given":"Hannah R."},{"family":"Shin","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Bernard","given":"Manon"},{"family":"Yet","given":"Idil"},{"family":"Smart","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Gorrie-Stone","given":"Tyler"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Al Chalabi","given":"Ammar"},{"family":"Ring","given":"Susan M."},{"family":"Pershagen","given":"Göran"},{"family":"Melén","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Jiménez-Conde","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Roquer","given":"Jaume"},{"family":"Lawlor","given":"Deborah A."},{"family":"Wright","given":"John"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Nicholas G."},{"family":"Montgomery","given":"Grant W."},{"family":"Moffitt","given":"Terrie E."},{"family":"Poulton","given":"Richie"},{"family":"Esko","given":"Tõnu"},{"family":"Milani","given":"Lili"},{"family":"Metspalu","given":"Andres"},{"family":"Perry","given":"John R.

Although citrus plants are among the most important fruit crops worldwide, the genetic basis of secondary metabolism in these plants is largely unknown. Here, we use a high-density linkage map to dissect large-scale flavonoid metabolic traits measured in different tissues (young leaf, old leaf, mature pericarp, and mature pulp) of an F1 pseudo-testcross citrus population. We detected 80 flavonoids in this population and identified 138 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 57 flavonoids in these four tissues. Based on transcriptional profiling and functional annotation, twenty-one candidate genes were identified, and one gene encoding flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) was functionally verified to result in naturally occurring variation in dihydrokaempferol content through genetic variations in its promoter and coding regions. The abundant data resources collected for diverse citrus germplasms here lay the foundation for complete characterization of the citrus flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and will thereby promote efficient utilization of metabolites in citrus quality improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Mou","given":"Jiaolin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhehui"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Haiji"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Ziquan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Junli"},{"family":"Fernie","given":"Alisdair R."},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Yunjiang"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Xiuxin"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Weiwei"}],"container-title":"Horticulture Research","DOI":"10.1038/s41438-021-00472-8","ISSN":"2052-7276","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"1-12","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Multiomics-based dissection of citrus flavonoid metabolism using a Citrus reticulata × Poncirus trifoliata population","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41438-021-00472-8","volume":"8"},
  {"id":"myles2009","abstract":"The goal of many plant scientists' research is to explain natural phenotypic variation in terms of simple changes in DNA sequence. Traditionally, linkage mapping has been the most commonly employed method to reach this goal: experimental crosses are made to generate a family with known relatedness, and attempts are made to identify cosegregation of genetic markers and phenotypes within this family. In vertebrate systems, association mapping (also known as linkage disequilibrium mapping) is increasingly being adopted as the mapping method of choice. Association mapping involves searching for genotype-phenotype correlations in unrelated individuals and often is more rapid and cost-effective than traditional linkage mapping. We emphasize here that linkage and association mapping are complementary approaches and are more similar than is often assumed. Unlike in vertebrates, where controlled crosses can be expensive or impossible (e.g., in humans), the plant scientific community can exploit the advantages of both controlled crosses and association mapping to increase statistical power and mapping resolution. While the time and money required for the collection of genotype data were critical considerations in the past, the increasing availability of inexpensive DNA sequencing and genotyping methods should prompt researchers to shift their attention to experimental design. This review provides thoughts on finding the optimal experimental mix of association mapping using unrelated individuals and controlled crosses to identify the genes underlying phenotypic variation.","author":[{"family":"Myles","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Peiffer","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Ersoz","given":"Elhan S."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhiwu"},{"family":"Costich","given":"Denise E."},{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."}],"container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1105/tpc.109.068437","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,8]]},"language":"eng","page":"2194-2202","PMCID":"PMC2751942","PMID":"19654263","source":"PubMed","title":"Association mapping: critical considerations shift from genotyping to experimental design","title-short":"Association mapping","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"myles2011","abstract":"The grape is one of the earliest domesticated fruit crops and, since antiquity, it has been widely cultivated and prized for its fruit and wine. Here, we characterize genome-wide patterns of genetic variation in over 1,000 samples of the domesticated grape, Vitis vinifera subsp. vinifera, and its wild relative, V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris from the US Department of Agriculture grape germplasm collection. We find support for a Near East origin of vinifera and present evidence of introgression from local sylvestris as the grape moved into Europe. High levels of genetic diversity and rapid linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay have been maintained in vinifera, which is consistent with a weak domestication bottleneck followed by thousands of years of widespread vegetative propagation. The considerable genetic diversity within vinifera, however, is contained within a complex network of close pedigree relationships that has been generated by crosses among elite cultivars. We show that first-degree relationships are rare between wine and table grapes and among grapes from geographically distant regions. Our results suggest that although substantial genetic diversity has been maintained in the grape subsequent to domestication, there has been a limited exploration of this diversity. We propose that the adoption of vegetative propagation was a double-edged sword: Although it provided a benefit by ensuring true breeding cultivars, it also discouraged the generation of unique cultivars through crosses. The grape currently faces severe pathogen pressures, and the long-term sustainability of the grape and wine industries will rely on the exploitation of the grape's tremendous natural genetic diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Myles","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Boyko","given":"Adam R."},{"family":"Owens","given":"Christopher L."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Grassi","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"Aradhya","given":"Mallikarjuna K."},{"family":"Prins","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Chia","given":"Jer-Ming"},{"family":"Ware","given":"Doreen"},{"family":"Bustamante","given":"Carlos D."},{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1009363108","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3530-3535","PMID":"21245334","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Genetic structure and domestication history of the grape","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/108/9/3530","volume":"108"},

  {"id":"nasser2021","abstract":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of noncoding loci that are associated with human diseases and complex traits, each of which could reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease1. Many of the underlying causal variants may affect enhancers2,3, but we lack accurate maps of enhancers and their target genes to interpret such variants. We recently developed the activity-by-contact (ABC) model to predict which enhancers regulate which genes and validated the model using CRISPR perturbations in several cell types4. Here we apply this ABC model to create enhancer–gene maps in 131 human cell types and tissues, and use these maps to interpret the functions of GWAS variants. Across 72 diseases and complex traits, ABC links 5,036 GWAS signals to 2,249 unique genes, including a class of 577 genes that appear to influence multiple phenotypes through variants in enhancers that act in different cell types. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causal variants are enriched in predicted enhancers by more than 20-fold in particular cell types such as dendritic cells, and ABC achieves higher precision than other regulatory methods at connecting noncoding variants to target genes. These variant-to-function maps reveal an enhancer that contains an IBD risk variant and that regulates the expression of PPIF to alter the membrane potential of mitochondria in macrophages. Our study reveals principles of genome regulation, identifies genes that affect IBD and provides a resource and generalizable strategy to connect risk variants of common diseases to their molecular and cellular functions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Nasser","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Bergman","given":"Drew T."},{"family":"Fulco","given":"Charles P."},{"family":"Guckelberger","given":"Philine"},{"family":"Doughty","given":"Benjamin R."},{"family":"Patwardhan","given":"Tejal A."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Thouis R."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Tung H."},{"family":"Ulirsch","given":"Jacob C."},{"family":"Lekschas","given":"Fritz"},{"family":"Mualim","given":"Kristy"},{"family":"Natri","given":"Heini M."},{"family":"Weeks","given":"Elle M."},{"family":"Munson","given":"Glen"},{"family":"Kane","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Helen Y."},{"family":"Cui","given":"Ang"},{"family":"Ray","given":"John P."},{"family":"Eisenhaure","given":"Thomas M."},{"family":"Collins","given":"Ryan L."},{"family":"Dey","given":"Kushal"},{"family":"Pfister","given":"Hanspeter"},{"family":"Price","given":"Alkes L."},{"family":"Epstein","given":"Charles B."},{"family":"Kundaje","given":"Anshul"},{"family":"Xavier","given":"Ramnik J."},{"family":"Daly","given":"Mark J."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Hailiang"},{"family":"Finucane","given":"Hilary K."},{"family":"Hacohen","given":"Nir"},{"family":"Lander","given":"Eric S."},{"family":"Engreitz","given":"Jesse M."}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03446-x","ISSN":"1476-4687","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,7]]},"language":"en","page":"1-6","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Genome-wide enhancer maps link risk variants to disease genes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03446-x"},

To date, many studies rely on univariate statistical tests for association between the phenotype and each assayed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). However, interaction between SNPs, namely epistasis, must be considered when tackling the complexity of underlying biological mechanisms. Epistasis analysis at large scale entails a prohibitive computational burden when addressing the detection of more than two interacting SNPs. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic causal graph-based method, SMMB, to analyze epistatic patterns in GWAS data.We present Stochastic Multiple Markov Blanket algorithm (SMMB), which combines both ensemble stochastic strategy inspired from random forests and Bayesian Markov blanket-based methods. We compared SMMB with three other recent algorithms using both simulated and real datasets. Our method outperforms the other compared methods for a majority of simulated cases of 2-way and 3-way epistasis patterns (especially in scenarii where minor allele frequencies of causal SNPs are low).

  {"id":"nozaki2012","abstract":"To study the regulatory mechanisms underlying lignin biosynthesis, we isolated and characterized lignescens (lig), a previously undescribed temperature-sensitive mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana that exhibits ectopic lignin deposition and growth defects under high-temperature conditions. The lig mutation was identified as a single base transition in GNA1 encoding glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA), a critical enzyme of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) biosynthesis. lig harbors a glycine-to-serine substitution at residue 68 (G68S) of GNA1. Enzyme activity assays of the mutant protein (GNA1G68S) showed its thermolability relative to the wild-type protein. The lig mutant exposed to the restrictive temperature contained a significantly smaller amount of UDP-GlcNAc than did the wild type. The growth defects and ectopic lignification of lig were suppressed by the addition of UDP-GlcNAc. Since UDP-GlcNAc is an initial sugar donor of N-glycan synthesis and impaired N-glycan synthesis is known to induce the unfolded protein response (UPR), we examined possible relationships between N-glycan synthesis, UPR, and the lig phenotype. N-glycans were reduced and LUMINAL BINDING PROTEIN3, a typical UPR gene, was expressed in lig at the restrictive temperature. Furthermore, treatment with UPR-inducing reagents phenocopied the lig mutant. Our data collectively suggest that impairment of N-glycan synthesis due to a shortage of UDP-GlcNAc leads to ectopic lignin accumulation, mostly through the UPR.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Nozaki","given":"Mamoru"},{"family":"Sugiyama","given":"Munetaka"},{"family":"Duan","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Uematsu","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Genda","given":"Tatsuya"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Yasushi"}],"container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"The Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1105/tpc.112.102806","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,1]]},"page":"3366-3379","source":"Silverchair","title":"A Missense Mutation in the Glucosamine-6-Phosphate N-Acetyltransferase–Encoding Gene Causes Temperature-Dependent Growth Defects and Ectopic Lignin Deposition in Arabidopsis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.112.102806","volume":"24"},

To elucidate the disease pathogenesis, it is essential to understand the function of these variants, especially under disease-associated conditions. Here, we performed a large-scale immune cell gene-expression analysis, together with whole-genome sequence analysis. Our dataset consists of 28 distinct immune cell subsets from 337 patients diagnosed with 10 categories of immune-mediated diseases and 79 healthy volunteers. Our dataset captured distinctive gene-expression profiles across immune cell types and diseases. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis revealed dynamic variations of eQTL effects in the context of immunological conditions, as well as cell types. These cell-type-specific and context-dependent eQTLs showed significant enrichment in immune disease-associated genetic variants, and they implicated the disease-relevant cell types, genes, and environment. This atlas deepens our understanding of the immunogenetic functions of disease-associated variants under in vivo disease conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Ota","given":"Mineto"},{"family":"Nagafuchi","given":"Yasuo"},{"family":"Hatano","given":"Hiroaki"},{"family":"Ishigaki","given":"Kazuyoshi"},{"family":"Terao","given":"Chikashi"},{"family":"Takeshima","given":"Yusuke"},{"family":"Yanaoka","given":"Haruyuki"},{"family":"Kobayashi","given":"Satomi"},{"family":"Okubo","given":"Mai"},{"family":"Shirai","given":"Harumi"},{"family":"Sugimori","given":"Yusuke"},{"family":"Maeda","given":"Junko"},{"family":"Nakano","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Yamada","given":"Saeko"},{"family":"Yoshida","given":"Ryochi"},{"family":"Tsuchiya","given":"Haruka"},{"family":"Tsuchida","given":"Yumi"},{"family":"Akizuki","given":"Shuji"},{"family":"Yoshifuji","given":"Hajime"},{"family":"Ohmura","given":"Koichiro"},{"family":"Mimori","given":"Tsuneyo"},{"family":"Yoshida","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Kurosaka","given":"Daitaro"},{"family":"Okada","given":"Masato"},{"family":"Setoguchi","given":"Keigo"},{"family":"Kaneko","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Ban","given":"Nobuhiro"},{"family":"Yabuki","given":"Nami"},{"family":"Matsuki","given":"Kosuke"},{"family":"Mutoh","given":"Hironori"},{"family":"Oyama","given":"Sohei"},{"family":"Okazaki","given":"Makoto"},{"family":"Tsunoda","given":"Hiroyuki"},{"family":"Iwasaki","given":"Yukiko"},{"family":"Sumitomo","given":"Shuji"},{"family":"Shoda","given":"Hirofumi"},{"family":"Kochi","given":"Yuta"},{"family":"Okada","given":"Yukinori"},{"family":"Yamamoto","given":"Kazuhiko"},{"family":"Okamura","given":"Tomohisa"},{"family":"Fujio","given":"Keishi"}],"container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2021.03.056","ISSN":"0092-8674","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,1]]},"language":"en","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Dynamic landscape of immune cell-specific gene regulation in immune-mediated diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421004293"},
  {"id":"ou2020","abstract":"Improvements in long-read data and scaffolding technologies have enabled rapid generation of reference-quality assemblies for complex genomes. Still, an assessment of critical sequence depth and read length is important for allocating limited resources. To this end, we have generated eight assemblies for the complex genome of the maize inbred line NC358 using PacBio datasets ranging from 20 to 75 × genomic depth and with N50 subread lengths of 11-21 kb. Assemblies with ≤30 × depth and N50 subread length of 11 kb are highly fragmented, with even low-copy genic regions showing degradation at 20 × depth. Distinct sequence-quality thresholds are observed for complete assembly of genes, transposable elements, and highly repetitive genomic features such as telomeres, heterochromatic knobs, and centromeres. In addition, we show high-quality optical maps can dramatically improve contiguity in even our most fragmented base assembly.

  {"id":"oziolor2019","abstract":"An unexpected advantage\nHuman activities are altering Earth's environment in many ways. Will other species be able to adapt in the face of rapid change? Adaptation requires genomic variability, but declining populations lose diversity, which casts doubt on adaptation as a survival mechanism in today's world. Oziolor et al. report a case of rapid adaptation to pollution in killifish, apparently enabled by introduction of a non-native congener within the last 30 generations (see the Perspective by Pfennig). This related species, possibly carried in ship ballast water, appears to have provided advantageous genetic variability that has allowed the native fish to adapt to its increasingly polluted environment.\nScience, this issue p. 455; see also p. 433\nRadical environmental change that provokes population decline can impose constraints on the sources of genetic variation that may enable evolutionary rescue. Adaptive toxicant resistance has rapidly evolved in Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) that occupy polluted habitats. We show that resistance scales with pollution level and negatively correlates with inducibility of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling. Loci with the strongest signatures of recent selection harbor genes regulating AHR signaling. Two of these loci introgressed recently (18 to 34 generations ago) from Atlantic killifish (F. heteroclitus). One introgressed locus contains a deletion in AHR that confers a large adaptive advantage [selection coefficient (s) = 0.8]. Given the limited migration of killifish, recent adaptive introgression was likely mediated by human-assisted transport. We suggest that interspecies connectivity may be an important source of adaptive variation during extreme environmental change.\nA non-native fish introduces toxicant-resistant genes to killifish threatened by pollution.\nA non-native fish introduces toxicant-resistant genes to killifish threatened by pollution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Oziolor","given":"Elias M."},{"family":"Reid","given":"Noah M."},{"family":"Yair","given":"Sivan"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Kristin M."},{"family":"VerPloeg","given":"Sarah Guberman"},{"family":"Bruns","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Joseph R."},{"family":"Whitehead","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Matson","given":"Cole W."}],"container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aav4155","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6439","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,3]]},"language":"en","page":"455-457","PMID":"31048485","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Article","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Adaptive introgression enables evolutionary rescue from extreme environmental pollution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6439/455","volume":"364"},

The polyploid nature of the cotton genome raises many evolutionary questions as to the relationships between duplicated genomes. We describe the evolution of the cotton genome (SNPs and structural variants) with the greatly improved resolution of 34 deeply re-sequenced genomes. We also explore the evolution of homoeologous regions in the AT- and DT-genomes and especially the phenomenon of conversion between genomes. We did not find any compelling evidence for homoeologous conversion between genomes. These findings are very different from other recent reports of frequent conversion events between genomes. We also identified several distinct regions of the genome that have been introgressed between G. hirsutum and G. barbadense, which presumably resulted from breeding efforts targeting associated beneficial alleles. Finally, the genotypic data resulting from this study provides access to a wealth of diversity sorely needed in the narrow germplasm of cotton cultivars.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Page","given":"Justin T."},{"family":"Liechty","given":"Zach S."},{"family":"Alexander","given":"Rich H."},{"family":"Clemons","given":"Kimberly"},{"family":"Hulse-Kemp","given":"Amanda M."},{"family":"Ashrafi","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Deynze","given":"Allen Van"},{"family":"Stelly","given":"David M."},{"family":"Udall","given":"Joshua A."}],"container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1006012","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,11]]},"language":"en","page":"e1006012","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"DNA Sequence Evolution and Rare Homoeologous Conversion in Tetraploid Cotton","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006012","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"pan2017","abstract":"Plant architecture is a key factor affecting planting density and grain yield in maize (Zea mays). However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, qPH3, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pan","given":"Qingchun"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Yuancheng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenqiang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jianbing"}],"container-title":"Plant Physiology","container-title-short":"Plant Physiol","DOI":"10.1104/pp.17.00709","ISSN":"0032-0889, 1532-2548","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"858-873","PMID":"28838954","publisher":"American Society of Plant Biologists","section":"Articles","source":"www.plantphysiol.org","title":"The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/175/2/858","volume":"175"},

  {"id":"partridge2020","abstract":"Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that have key roles in gene regulation1,2. Genome-wide occupancy maps of transcriptional regulators are important for understanding gene regulation and its effects on diverse biological processes3–6. However, only a minority of the more than 1,600 transcription factors encoded in the human genome has been assayed. Here we present, as part of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project, data and analyses from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP–seq) experiments using the human HepG2 cell line for 208 chromatin-associated proteins (CAPs). These comprise 171 transcription factors and 37 transcriptional cofactors and chromatin regulator proteins, and represent nearly one-quarter of CAPs expressed in HepG2 cells. The binding profiles of these CAPs form major groups associated predominantly with promoters or enhancers, or with both. We confirm and expand the current catalogue of DNA sequence motifs for transcription factors, and describe motifs that correspond to other transcription factors that are co-enriched with the primary ChIP target. For example, FOX family motifs are enriched in ChIP–seq peaks of 37 other CAPs. We show that motif content and occupancy patterns can distinguish between promoters and enhancers. This catalogue reveals high-occupancy target regions at which many CAPs associate, although each contains motifs for only a minority of the numerous associated transcription factors. These analyses provide a more complete overview of the gene regulatory networks that define this cell type, and demonstrate the usefulness of the large-scale production efforts of the ENCODE Consortium.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Partridge","given":"E.

  {"id":"phillips2008","abstract":"Epistasis has been used to describe a number of phenomena, including the functional interaction between genes, the genetic outcome of mutations acting within the same genetic pathway, and the statistical deviation from additive gene action. Converging interests across genetics suggests that it is now time to develop a more unified view of epistasis and gene interactions.One of the traditional uses of epistasis analysis has been to order genes within developmental and metabolic pathways. These approaches have recently become much more systematic through the use of high-throughput genetic screens, especially in yeast. These studies show that gene interactions are ubiquitous and can be used to help understand the structure of complex genetic networks.The major limitation of comprehensive analyses of gene interactions is the total number of interactions that must ultimately be tested, which grows at approximately the square of the number of genes (for example, >18 million interactions in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome). Future work in this area will need to focus on particular subsets of this interaction space using information from other sources, such as functional genomics.Epistasis can be a major barrier to inferring the genetic basis of complex traits within natural populations. The effects of many QTLs might be obscured by interactions with other loci, which can make mapping difficult.Human genetic disease is one area in which epistasis seems to be fairly common, although we have few examples in which the functional basis of a particular interaction has been demonstrated. Epistasis is one possible explanation for why human mapping results can be difficult to replicate.Epistasis arises as a natural by-product of the evolutionary process, as all subsequent evolutionary change is built upon genetic changes that have occurred previously.There is clear evidence that epistasis helps to structure the possible pathways that evolution can follow but, even after nearly a century of debate on the topic, we still do not know if epistasis creates a major barrier to evolutionary change.An increased focus on the quantitative effects of gene interactions will provide the basis for a unified approach to studies of gene interaction, while providing a point of articulation between genetics, functional genomics, evolutionary genetics and systems biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"Patrick C."}],"container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/nrg2452","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,11]]},"language":"en","number":"11","page":"855-867","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Epistasis — the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2452","volume":"9"},

Our method improves on previous work by explicitly accounting for recent population history before performing the analyses. Using sequence data from the Environmental Genome Project, we find strong evidence for ancient admixture in both a European and a West African population (p ≈ 10−7), with contributions to the modern gene pool of at least 5%.

We report a meta-analysis of twin correlations and reported variance components for 17,804 traits from 2,748 publications including 14,558,903 partly dependent twin pairs, virtually all published twin studies of complex traits. Estimates of heritability cluster strongly within functional domains, and across all traits the reported heritability is 49%. For a majority (69%) of traits, the observed twin correlations are consistent with a simple and parsimonious model where twin resemblance is solely due to additive genetic variation. The data are inconsistent with substantial influences from shared environment or non-additive genetic variation. This study provides the most comprehensive analysis of the causes of individual differences in human traits thus far and will guide future gene-mapping efforts.

This discussion also serves as a succinct primer on some of the pivotal epidemiological analyses (and their communication) during the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak, as seen through the lens of a Twitter feed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Pollett","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Rivers","given":"Caitlin"}],"container-title":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","container-title-short":"Clinical Infectious Diseases","DOI":"10.1093/cid/ciaa553","ISSN":"1058-4838","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,19]]},"page":"2184-2186","source":"Silverchair","title":"Social Media and the New World of Scientific Communication During the COVID-19 Pandemic","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa553","volume":"71"},
  {"id":"porcu2019","abstract":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants associated with complex traits, but their biological interpretation often remains unclear. Most of these variants overlap with expression QTLs, indicating their potential involvement in regulation of gene expression. Here, we propose a transcriptome-wide summary statistics-based Mendelian Randomization approach (TWMR) that uses multiple SNPs as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as exposures, simultaneously. Applied to 43 human phenotypes, it uncovers 3,913 putatively causal gene–trait associations, 36% of which have no genome-wide significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS. Using independent association summary statistics, we find that the majority of these loci were missed by GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these links is educational attainment-associated BSCL2, known to carry mutations leading to a Mendelian form of encephalopathy. We also find pleiotropic causal effects suggestive of mechanistic connections. TWMR better accounts for pleiotropy and has the potential to identify biological mechanisms underlying complex traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Porcu","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Rüeger","given":"Sina"},{"family":"Lepik","given":"Kaido"},{"family":"Santoni","given":"Federico A."},{"family":"Reymond","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Kutalik","given":"Zoltán"}],"container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-019-10936-0","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,24]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Gene expression;Quantitative trait;Statistical methods\nSubject_term_id: gene-expression;quantitative-trait;statistical-methods","number":"1","page":"3300","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Mendelian randomization integrating GWAS and eQTL data reveals genetic determinants of complex and clinical traits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10936-0","volume":"10"},

We propose a method to decompose the observational correlation between gene expression and phenotypes driven by confounders, forward- and reverse causal effects. The bi-directional causal effects between gene expression and complex traits are obtained by Mendelian Randomization integrating summary-level data from GWAS and whole-blood eQTLs. Applying this approach to complex traits reveals that forward effects have negligible contribution. For example, BMI- and triglycerides-gene expression correlation coefficients robustly correlate with trait-to-expression causal effects (rBMI = 0.11, PBMI = 2.0 × 10−51 and rTG = 0.13, PTG = 1.1 × 10−68), but not detectably with expression-to-trait effects.

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Purcell","given":"Shaun"},{"family":"Neale","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Todd-Brown","given":"Kathe"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Lori"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Manuel A.

Whether or not environmentally induced phenotypes are sufficiently recurrent and fit to leave a signature in adaptive evolution is debated. Here, we analyze multivariate data from 34 plant reciprocal transplant studies to test: (1) if plasticity is an adaptive source of developmental bias that makes locally adapted populations resemble the environmentally induced phenotypes of ancestors; and (2) if plasticity, standing phenotypic variation and genetic divergence align during local adaptation. Phenotypic variation increased marginally in foreign environments but, as predicted, the direction of ancestral plasticity was generally well aligned with the phenotypic difference between locally adapted populations, making plasticity appear to 'take the lead' in adaptive evolution. Plastic responses were sometimes more extreme than the phenotypes of locally adapted plants, which can give the impression that plasticity and evolutionary adaptation oppose each other; however, environmentally induced and locally adapted phenotypes were rarely misaligned. Adaptive fine-tuning of phenotypes—genetic accommodation—did not fall along the main axis of standing phenotypic variation or the direction of plasticity, and local adaptation did not consistently modify the direction or magnitude of plasticity. These results suggest that plasticity is a persistent source of developmental bias that shapes how plant populations adapt to environmental change, even when plasticity does not constrain how populations respond to selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Radersma","given":"Reinder"},{"family":"Noble","given":"Daniel W.

  {"id":"reich2009","abstract":"India has been underrepresented in genome-wide surveys of human variation. We analyse 25 diverse groups in India to provide strong evidence for two ancient populations, genetically divergent, that are ancestral to most Indians today. One, the ‘Ancestral North Indians’ (ANI), is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans, whereas the other, the ‘Ancestral South Indians’ (ASI), is as distinct from ANI and East Asians as they are from each other. By introducing methods that can estimate ancestry without accurate ancestral populations, we show that ANI ancestry ranges from 39–71% in most Indian groups, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers. Groups with only ASI ancestry may no longer exist in mainland India. However, the indigenous Andaman Islanders are unique in being ASI-related groups without ANI ancestry. Allele frequency differences between groups in India are larger than in Europe, reflecting strong founder effects whose signatures have been maintained for thousands of years owing to endogamy. We therefore predict that there will be an excess of recessive diseases in India, which should be possible to screen and map genetically.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Reich","given":"David"},{"family":"Thangaraj","given":"Kumarasamy"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Price","given":"Alkes L."},{"family":"Singh","given":"Lalji"}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature08365","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7263","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9]]},"language":"en","number":"7263","page":"489-494","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Reconstructing Indian population history","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08365","volume":"461"},

  {"id":"roberts2021","abstract":"This book develops an effective theory approach to understanding deep neural networks of practical relevance. Beginning from a first-principles component-level picture of networks, we explain how to determine an accurate description of the output of trained networks by solving layer-to-layer iteration equations and nonlinear learning dynamics. A main result is that the predictions of networks are described by nearly-Gaussian distributions, with the depth-to-width aspect ratio of the network controlling the deviations from the infinite-width Gaussian description. We explain how these effectively-deep networks learn nontrivial representations from training and more broadly analyze the mechanism of representation learning for nonlinear models. From a nearly-kernel-methods perspective, we find that the dependence of such models' predictions on the underlying learning algorithm can be expressed in a simple and universal way. To obtain these results, we develop the notion of representation group flow (RG flow) to characterize the propagation of signals through the network. By tuning networks to criticality, we give a practical solution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. We further explain how RG flow leads to near-universal behavior and lets us categorize networks built from different activation functions into universality classes. Altogether, we show that the depth-to-width ratio governs the effective model complexity of the ensemble of trained networks. By using information-theoretic techniques, we estimate the optimal aspect ratio at which we expect the network to be practically most useful and show how residual connections can be used to push this scale to arbitrary depths. With these tools, we can learn in detail about the inductive bias of architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"Daniel A."},{"family":"Yaida","given":"Sho"},{"family":"Hanin","given":"Boris"}],"container-title":"arXiv:2106.10165 [hep-th, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,24]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Principles of Deep Learning Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10165"},

Chromatin structural assays can efficiently integrate information across diverse regulatory elements, revealing the functional noncoding genome. In this study, we use a differential nuclease sensitivity assay based on micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion to discover open chromatin regions in the maize genome. We find that maize MNase-hypersensitive (MNase HS) regions localize around active genes and within recombination hotspots, focusing biased gene conversion at their flanks. Although MNase HS regions map to less than 1% of the genome, they consistently explain a remarkably large amount (∼40%) of heritable phenotypic variance in diverse complex traits. MNase HS regions are therefore on par with coding sequences as annotations that demarcate the functional parts of the maize genome. These results imply that less than 3% of the maize genome (coding and MNase HS regions) may give rise to the overwhelming majority of phenotypic variation, greatly narrowing the scope of the functional genome.","author":[{"family":"Rodgers-Melnick","given":"Eli"},{"family":"Vera","given":"Daniel L."},{"family":"Bass","given":"Hank W."},{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1525244113","ISSN":"1091-6490","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,31]]},"language":"eng","page":"E3177-3184","PMCID":"PMC4896728","PMID":"27185945","source":"PubMed","title":"Open chromatin reveals the functional maize genome","type":"article-journal","volume":"113"},
  {"id":"rojano2019","abstract":"Variants within non-coding genomic regions can greatly affect disease. In recent years, increasing focus has been given to these variants, and how they can alter regulatory elements, such as enhancers, transcription factor binding sites and DNA methylation regions. Such variants can be considered regulatory variants. Concurrently, much effort has been put into establishing international consortia to undertake large projects aimed at discovering regulatory elements in different tissues, cell lines and organisms, and probing the effects of genetic variants on regulation by measuring gene expression. Here, we describe methods and techniques for discovering disease-associated non-coding variants using sequencing technologies. We then explain the computational procedures that can be used for annotating these variants using the information from the aforementioned projects, and prediction of their putative effects, including potential pathogenicity, based on rule-based and machine learning approaches. We provide the details of techniques to validate these predictions, by mapping chromatin–chromatin and chromatin–protein interactions, and introduce Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Associated Protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) technology, which has already been used in this ﬁeld and is likely to have a big impact on its future evolution. We also give examples of regulatory variants associated with multiple complex diseases. This review is aimed at bioinformaticians interested in the characterization of regulatory variants, molecular biologists and geneticists interested in understanding more about the nature and potential role of such variants from a functional point of views, and clinicians who may wish to learn about variants in non-coding genomic regions associated with a given disease and ﬁnd out what to do next to uncover how they impact on the underlying mechanisms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Rojano","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Seoane","given":"Pedro"},{"family":"Ranea","given":"Juan A G"},{"family":"Perkins","given":"James R"}],"container-title":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bib/bby039","ISSN":"1467-5463, 1477-4054","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,27]]},"language":"en","page":"1639-1654","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Regulatory variants: from detection to predicting impact","title-short":"Regulatory variants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/20/5/1639/5035219","volume":"20"},

Some phenotypes, however (for example, the development of language), are inherently difficult to study using model species.It might be possible to use induced pluripotent stem cells derived differentiated cells from humans and non-human primates to test functionally for the outcomes of inter-species differences in gene regulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Romero","given":"Irene Gallego"},{"family":"Ruvinsky","given":"Ilya"},{"family":"Gilad","given":"Yoav"}],"container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/nrg3229","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,7]]},"language":"en","number":"7","page":"505-516","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Comparative studies of gene expression and the evolution of gene regulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3229","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"ruth2021","abstract":"Reproductive longevity is essential for fertility and influences healthy ageing in women1,2, but insights into its underlying biological mechanisms and treatments to preserve it are limited. Here we identify 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, assessed using normal variation in age at natural menopause (ANM) in about 200,000 women of European ancestry. These common alleles were associated with clinical extremes of ANM; women in the top 1% of genetic susceptibility have an equivalent risk of premature ovarian insufficiency to those carrying monogenic FMR1 premutations3. The identified loci implicate a broad range of DNA damage response (DDR) processes and include loss-of-function variants in key DDR-associated genes. Integration with experimental models demonstrates that these DDR processes act across the life-course to shape the ovarian reserve and its rate of depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental manipulation of DDR pathways highlighted by human genetics increases fertility and extends reproductive life in mice. Causal inference analyses using the identified genetic variants indicate that extending reproductive life in women improves bone health and reduces risk of type 2 diabetes, but increases the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms that govern ovarian ageing, when they act, and how they might be targeted by therapeutic approaches to extend fertility and prevent disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruth","given":"Katherine S."},{"family":"Day","given":"Felix R."},{"family":"Hussain","given":"Jazib"},{"family":"Martínez-Marchal","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Aiken","given":"Catherine E."},{"family":"Azad","given":"Ajuna"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Deborah J."},{"family":"Knoblochova","given":"Lucie"},{"family":"Abe","given":"Hironori"},{"family":"Tarry-Adkins","given":"Jane L."},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Javier Martin"},{"family":"Fontanillas","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Claringbould","given":"Annique"},{"family":"Bakker","given":"Olivier B."},{"family":"Sulem","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Walters","given":"Robin G."},{"family":"Terao","given":"Chikashi"},{"family":"Turon","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Horikoshi","given":"Momoko"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Kuang"},{"family":"Onland-Moret","given":"N.

Several features were suggested to underlie CFS instability, however, these features are prevalent across the genome. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying CFS instability remain unclear. Here, we explore the transcriptional profile and DNA replication timing (RT) under mild replication stress in the context of the 3D genome organization. The results reveal a fragility signature, comprised of a TAD boundary overlapping a highly transcribed large gene with APH-induced RT-delay. This signature enables precise mapping of core fragility regions in known CFSs and identification of novel fragile sites. CFS stability may be compromised by incomplete DNA replication and repair in TAD boundaries core fragility regions leading to genomic instability. The identified fragility signature will allow for a more comprehensive mapping of CFSs and pave the way for investigating mechanisms promoting genomic instability in cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Sarni","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Sasaki","given":"Takayo"},{"family":"Irony Tur-Sinai","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Miron","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Rivera-Mulia","given":"Juan Carlos"},{"family":"Magnuson","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Ljungman","given":"Mats"},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"David M."},{"family":"Kerem","given":"Batsheva"}],"container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-17448-2","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,17]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"3613","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"3D genome organization contributes to genome instability at fragile sites","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17448-2","volume":"11"},

We detected extensive spatiotemporal heterogeneity among progenitor cells and a gradual divergence in the regulatory programs of cerebellar neurons during differentiation. Comparisons to vertebrate genomes and snATAC-seq profiles for ∼20,000 cerebellar cells from the marsupial opossum revealed a shared decrease in CRE conservation during development and differentiation, but also differences in constraint between cell types. Our work delineates the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of gene regulation in cerebellar cells and provides insights into mammalian organ development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Sarropoulos","given":"Ioannis"},{"family":"Sepp","given":"Mari"},{"family":"Frömel","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Leiss","given":"Kevin"},{"family":"Trost","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Leushkin","given":"Evgeny"},{"family":"Okonechnikov","given":"Konstantin"},{"family":"Joshi","given":"Piyush"},{"family":"Giere","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Kutscher","given":"Lena M."},{"family":"Cardoso-Moreira","given":"Margarida"},{"family":"Pfister","given":"Stefan M."},{"family":"Kaessmann","given":"Henrik"}],"container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.abg4696","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,29]]},"language":"en","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Article","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Developmental and evolutionary dynamics of cis-regulatory elements in mouse cerebellar cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/07/28/science.abg4696"},

  {"id":"shao2019","abstract":"Utilization of heterosis has greatly increased the productivity of many crops worldwide. Although tremendous progress has been made in characterizing the genetic basis of heterosis using genomic technologies, molecular mechanisms underlying the genetic components are much less understood. Allele-specific expression (ASE), or imbalance between the expression levels of two parental alleles in the hybrid, has been suggested as a mechanism of heterosis. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of ASE by comparing the read ratios of the parental alleles in RNA-sequencing data of an elite rice hybrid and its parents using three tissues from plants grown under four conditions. The analysis identified a total of 3,270 genes showing ASE (ASEGs) in various ways, which can be classified into two patterns: consistent ASEGs such that the ASE was biased toward one parental allele in all tissues/conditions, and inconsistent ASEGs such that ASE was found in some but not all tissues/conditions, including direction-shifting ASEGs in which the ASE was biased toward one parental allele in some tissues/conditions while toward the other parental allele in other tissues/conditions. The results suggested that these patterns may have distinct implications in the genetic basis of heterosis: The consistent ASEGs may cause partial to full dominance effects on the traits that they regulate, and direction-shifting ASEGs may cause overdominance. We also showed that ASEGs were significantly enriched in genomic regions that were differentially selected during rice breeding. These ASEGs provide an index of the genes for future pursuit of the genetic and molecular mechanism of heterosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Shao","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Conghao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Che","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xianmeng"},{"family":"Song","given":"Jiaming"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xianghua"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Jinghua"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ling-Ling"},{"family":"Ouyang","given":"Yidan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qifa"}],"container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1820513116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,19]]},"language":"en","page":"5653-5658","PMID":"30833384","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Patterns of genome-wide allele-specific expression in hybrid rice and the implications on the genetic basis of heterosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/12/5653","volume":"116"},

Comparative genomics identified large structural variations and syntenic genes in the recombination regions, suggesting that recombination was related to structural variation and occurred preferentially in the distal chromosomal regions. Correlation analysis indicated that recombination was only slightly affected by geographical distribution and breeding period. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed with 15 agronomic traits using 267 cotton accessions and identified 163 quantitative trait loci (QTL) and an important candidate gene (Ghir_COL2) for early maturity traits. Comparative analysis of recombination and a GWAS revealed that the QTL of fibre quality traits tended to be more common in high-recombination regions than were those of yield and early maturity traits. These results provide insights into the population-scaled recombination landscape, suggesting that recombination contributed to the domestication and improvement of cotton, which provides a useful reference for studying recombination in other species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Nian"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Maojun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xianlong"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Zhongxu"}],"container-title":"The Plant Journal","DOI":"10.1111/tpj.14339","ISSN":"1365-313X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tpj.14339","page":"494-505","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Population genomics reveals a fine-scale recombination landscape for genetic improvement of cotton","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tpj.14339","volume":"99"},

In contrast, plants overexpressing <i>OsPHR2</i> show improved mycorrhizal infection and are partially resistant to P-mediated inhibition of symbiosis.

  {"id":"silva2014","abstract":"MOTIVATION: The detection of genomic regions unusually rich in a given pattern is an important undertaking in the analysis of next-generation sequencing data. Recent studies of chromosomal translocations in activated B lymphocytes have identified regions that are frequently translocated to c-myc oncogene. A quantitative method for the identification of translocation hotspots was crucial to this study. Here we improve this analysis by using a simple probabilistic model and the framework provided by scan statistics to define the number and location of translocation breakpoint hotspots. A key feature of our method is that it provides a global chromosome-wide nominal control level to clustering, as opposed to previous methods based on local criteria. While being motivated by a specific application, the detection of unusual clusters is a widespread problem in bioinformatics. We expect our method to be useful in the analysis of data from other experimental approaches such as of ChIP-seq and 4C-seq.\nRESULTS: The analysis of translocations from B lymphocytes with the method described here reveals the presence of longer hotspots when compared with those defined previously. Further, we show that the hotspot size changes substantially in the absence of DNA repair protein 53BP1. When 53BP1 deficiency is combined with overexpression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, the hotspot length increases even further. These changes are not detected by previous methods that use local significance criteria for clustering. Our method is also able to identify several exclusive translocation hotspots located in genes of known tumor supressors.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The detection of translocation hotspots is done with hot_scan, a program implemented in R and Perl.

  {"id":"sonehara2020","abstract":"Genetic linkage analysis has made a huge contribution to the genetic mapping of Mendelian diseases. However, most previously available linkage analysis methods have limited applicability. Since parametric linkage analysis requires predefined model of inheritance with a fixed set of parameters, it is inapplicable without fully structured pedigree information. Furthermore, the analytical results are dependent on the specification of model parameters. While non-parametric linkage analysis can avoid these problems, the runs of homozygosity (ROH) mapping, a widely used non-parametric linkage analysis method, can only deal with recessive inheritance. The implementation of non-parametric linkage analyses capable of dealing with both dominant and recessive inheritance has been required.We have developed the Obelisc (Observational linkage scan), a flexibly applicable user-friendly non-parametric linkage analysis tool, which also provides an intuitive visualization of the analytical results. Obelisc is based on the SNP streak approach, which does not require any predefined inheritance model with parameters. In contrast to the ROH mapping, the SNP streak approach is applicable to both dominant and recessive traits. To illustrate the performance of Obelisc, we generated a pseudo-pedigree from the publicly available BioBank Japan Project genome-wide genotype dataset (n &gt; 180 000). By applying Obelisc to this pseudo-pedigree, we successfully identified the regions with inherited identical-by-descent haplotypes shared among the members of the pseudo-pedigree, which was validated by the population-based haplotype phasing approach.Obelisc is feely available at https://github.com/qsonehara/Obelisc as a python package with example datasets.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Sonehara","given":"Kyuto"},{"family":"Okada","given":"Yukinori"}],"container-title":"Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa940","ISSN":"1367-4803","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,15]]},"page":"5567-5570","source":"Silverchair","title":"Obelisc: an identical-by-descent mapping tool based on SNP streak","title-short":"Obelisc","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa940","volume":"36"},

For example, previous studies using single-cell RNA sequencing identified at least 9 major cell types and up to 26 distinct subtypes in the dorsal cortex alone1,2. Here we characterize cell-type-specific cis-regulatory chromatin interactions, open chromatin peaks, and transcriptomes for radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, excitatory neurons, and interneurons isolated from mid-gestational samples of the human cortex. We show that chromatin interactions underlie several aspects of gene regulation, with transposable elements and disease-associated variants enriched at distal interacting regions in a cell-type-specific manner. In addition, promoters with increased levels of chromatin interactivity—termed super-interactive promoters—are enriched for lineage-specific genes, suggesting that interactions at these loci contribute to the fine-tuning of transcription. Finally, we develop CRISPRview, a technique that integrates immunostaining, CRISPR interference, RNAscope, and image analysis to validate cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements in heterogeneous populations of primary cells. Our findings provide insights into cell-type-specific gene expression patterns in the developing human cortex and advance our understanding of gene regulation and lineage specification during this crucial developmental window.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Song","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Pebworth","given":"Mark-Phillip"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiaoyu"},{"family":"Abnousi","given":"Armen"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Changxu"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Jia"},{"family":"Rosen","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Choudhary","given":"Mayank N.

SVs can alter the copy number of regulatory elements or modify the 3D genome by disrupting higher-order chromatin organization such as topologically associating domains. As a result of these position effects, SVs can influence the expression of genes distant from the SV breakpoints, thereby causing disease. The impact of SVs on the 3D genome and on gene expression regulation has to be considered when interpreting the pathogenic potential of these variant types.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Spielmann","given":"Malte"},{"family":"Lupiáñez","given":"Darío G."},{"family":"Mundlos","given":"Stefan"}],"container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41576-018-0007-0","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7]]},"language":"en","number":"7","page":"453-467","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Structural variation in the 3D genome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0007-0","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"stranger2012","abstract":"The genetic basis of gene expression variation has long been studied with the aim to understand the landscape of regulatory variants, but also more recently to assist in the interpretation and elucidation of disease signals. To date, many studies have looked in specific tissues and population-based samples, but there has been limited assessment of the degree of inter-population variability in regulatory variation. We analyzed genome-wide gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a total of 726 individuals from 8 global populations from the HapMap3 project and correlated gene expression levels with HapMap3 SNPs located in cis to the genes. We describe the influence of ancestry on gene expression levels within and between these diverse human populations and uncover a non-negligible impact on global patterns of gene expression. We further dissect the specific functional pathways differentiated between populations. We also identify 5,691 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) after controlling for both non-genetic factors and population admixture and observe that half of the cis-eQTLs are replicated in one or more of the populations. We highlight patterns of eQTL-sharing between populations, which are partially determined by population genetic relatedness, and discover significant sharing of eQTL effects between Asians, European-admixed, and African subpopulations. Specifically, we observe that both the effect size and the direction of effect for eQTLs are highly conserved across populations. We observe an increasing proximity of eQTLs toward the transcription start site as sharing of eQTLs among populations increases, highlighting that variants close to TSS have stronger effects and therefore are more likely to be detected across a wider panel of populations. Together these results offer a unique picture and resource of the degree of differentiation among human populations in functional regulatory variation and provide an estimate for the transferability of complex trait variants across populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Stranger","given":"Barbara E."},{"family":"Montgomery","given":"Stephen B."},{"family":"Dimas","given":"Antigone S."},{"family":"Parts","given":"Leopold"},{"family":"Stegle","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Ingle","given":"Catherine E."},{"family":"Sekowska","given":"Magda"},{"family":"Smith","given":"George Davey"},{"family":"Evans","given":"David"},{"family":"Gutierrez-Arcelus","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Price","given":"Alkes"},{"family":"Raj","given":"Towfique"},{"family":"Nisbett","given":"James"},{"family":"Nica","given":"Alexandra C."},{"family":"Beazley","given":"Claude"},{"family":"Durbin","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Deloukas","given":"Panos"},{"family":"Dermitzakis","given":"Emmanouil T."}],"container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1002639","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,4,19]]},"language":"en","page":"e1002639","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Patterns of Cis Regulatory Variation in Diverse Human Populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002639","volume":"8"},

Strober et al. set out to explore how genetic diversity regulates gene expression in cell differentiation over time. They examined expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLS)—genetic variants correlated with gene expression—in induced pluripotent stem cell lines from 19 Yoruban individuals at 16 time points during differentiation into cardiomyocytes. They identified hundreds of developmental stage–specific eQTLs. Thus, the impact of genetic variations depends on the developmental context or tissue under observation.\nScience, this issue p. 1287\nGenetic regulation of gene expression is dynamic, as transcription can change during cell differentiation and across cell types. We mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) throughout differentiation to elucidate the dynamics of genetic effects on cell type–specific gene expression. We generated time-series RNA sequencing data, capturing 16 time points during the differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes, in 19 human cell lines. We identified hundreds of dynamic eQTLs that change over time, with enrichment in enhancers of relevant cell types. We also found nonlinear dynamic eQTLs, which affect only intermediate stages of differentiation and cannot be found by using data from mature tissues. These fleeting genetic associations with gene regulation may explain some of the components of complex traits and disease. We highlight one example of a nonlinear eQTL that is associated with body mass index.\nGenetic variation affects temporal dynamics of gene expression in human cardiomyocyte differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells.\nGenetic variation affects temporal dynamics of gene expression in human cardiomyocyte differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Strober","given":"B.

These findings have been utilized to dissect the biological basis of diseases, to develop new drugs, to advance precision medicine and to boost breeding. However, the potential of GWAS is still underexploited due to methodological limitations. Many challenges have emerged, including detecting epistasis and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with small effects and distinguishing causal variants from other SNPs associated through linkage disequilibrium. These issues have motivated advancements in GWAS analyses in two contrasting cultures—statistical modelling and machine learning. In this review, we systematically present the basic concepts and the benefits and limitations in both methods. We further discuss recent efforts to mitigate their weaknesses. Additionally, we summarize the state-of-the-art tools for detecting the missed signals, ultrarare mutations and gene–gene interactions and for prioritizing SNPs.

In the present study, we report the haplotype-resolved genomes of the cultivated apple (Malus domestica cv. Gala) and its two major wild progenitors, M. sieversii and M. sylvestris. Substantial variations are identified between the two haplotypes of each genome. Inference of genome ancestry identifies ~23% of the Gala genome as of hybrid origin. Deep sequencing of 91 accessions identifies selective sweeps in cultivated apples that originated from either of the two progenitors and are associated with important domestication traits. Construction and analyses of apple pan-genomes uncover thousands of new genes, with hundreds of them being selected from one of the progenitors and largely fixed in cultivated apples, revealing that introgression of new genes/alleles is a hallmark of apple domestication through hybridization. Finally, transcriptome profiles of Gala fruits at 13 developmental stages unravel ~19% of genes displaying allele-specific expression, including many associated with fruit quality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Xuepeng"},{"family":"Jiao","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Schwaninger","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Chao","given":"C.

  {"id":"tang2021","abstract":"Citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) is one of the most devastating diseases in citrus industry worldwide. Most citrus cultivars such as sweet orange are susceptible to canker disease. Here, we utilized wild citrus to identify canker-resistant germplasms, and found that Atalantia buxifolia, a primitive (distant-wild) citrus, exhibited remarkable resistance to canker disease. Although the susceptibility gene LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES 1 (LOB1) could also be induced in Atalantia after canker infection, the induction extent was far lower than that in sweet orange. In addition, three of amino acids encoded by transcription factor TFIIAγ in Atalantia (AbTFIIAγ) exhibited difference from those in sweet orange (CsTFIIAγ) which could stabilize the interaction between effector PthA4 and effector binding element (EBE) of LOB1 promoter. The mutation of AbTFIIAγ did not change its interaction with transcription factor binding motifs (TFBs). However, the AbTFIIAγ could hardly support the LOB1 expression induced by the PthA4. In addition, the activity of AbLOB1 promoter was significantly lower than that of CsLOB1 under the induction by PthA4. Our results demonstrate that natural variations of AbTFIIAγ and effector binding element (EBE) in the AbLOB1 promoter are crucial for the canker disease resistance of Atalantia. The natural mutations of AbTFIIAγ gene and AbLOB1 promoter in Atalantia provide candidate targets for improving the resistance to citrus canker disease.","author":[{"family":"Tang","given":"Xiaomei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xia"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Xiaolin"},{"family":"Rao","given":"Muhammad Junaid"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Yuantao"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Xiuxin"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Qiang"}],"container-title":"PLoS genetics","container-title-short":"PLoS Genet","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1009316","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"e1009316","PMCID":"PMC7861543","PMID":"33493197","source":"PubMed","title":"Natural variations of TFIIAγ gene and LOB1 promoter contribute to citrus canker disease resistance in Atalantia buxifolia","type":"article-journal","volume":"17"},

Leveraging the large diversity of tissues, we provide insights into the tissue specificity of genetic effects and show that cell type composition is a key factor in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in human tissues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,11]]},"author":[{"literal":"The GTEx Consortium"}],"container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aaz1776","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6509","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,11]]},"language":"en","page":"1318-1330","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The GTEx Consortium atlas of genetic regulatory effects across human tissues","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aaz1776","volume":"369"},

  {"id":"todesco2020","abstract":"Species often include multiple ecotypes that are adapted to different environments1. However, it is unclear how ecotypes arise and how their distinctive combinations of adaptive alleles are maintained despite hybridization with non-adapted populations2–4. Here, by resequencing 1,506 wild sunflowers from 3 species (Helianthus annuus, Helianthus petiolaris and Helianthus argophyllus), we identify 37 large (1–100 Mbp in size), non-recombining haplotype blocks that are associated with numerous ecologically relevant traits, as well as soil and climate characteristics. Limited recombination in these haplotype blocks keeps adaptive alleles together, and these regions differentiate sunflower ecotypes. For example, haplotype blocks control a 77-day difference in flowering between ecotypes of the silverleaf sunflower H. argophyllus (probably through deletion of a homologue of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)), and are associated with seed size, flowering time and soil fertility in dune-adapted sunflowers. These haplotypes are highly divergent, frequently associated with structural variants and often appear to represent introgressions from other—possibly now-extinct—congeners. These results highlight a pervasive role of structural variation in ecotypic adaptation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Todesco","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Owens","given":"Gregory L."},{"family":"Bercovich","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Légaré","given":"Jean-Sébastien"},{"family":"Soudi","given":"Shaghayegh"},{"family":"Burge","given":"Dylan O."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Kaichi"},{"family":"Ostevik","given":"Katherine L."},{"family":"Drummond","given":"Emily B.

  {"id":"urbut2019","abstract":"We introduce new statistical methods for analyzing genomic data sets that measure many effects in many conditions (for example, gene expression changes under many treatments). These new methods improve on existing methods by allowing for arbitrary correlations in effect sizes among conditions. This flexible approach increases power, improves effect estimates and allows for more quantitative assessments of effect-size heterogeneity compared to simple shared or condition-specific assessments. We illustrate these features through an analysis of locally acting variants associated with gene expression (cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) in 44 human tissues. Our analysis identifies more eQTLs than existing approaches, consistent with improved power. We show that although genetic effects on expression are extensively shared among tissues, effect sizes can still vary greatly among tissues. Some shared eQTLs show stronger effects in subsets of biologically related tissues (for example, brain-related tissues), or in only one tissue (for example, testis). Our methods are widely applicable, computationally tractable for many conditions and available online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Urbut","given":"Sarah M."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Gao"},{"family":"Carbonetto","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Stephens","given":"Matthew"}],"container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-018-0268-8","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Genomics;Statistics\nSubject_term_id: genomics;statistics","number":"1","page":"187-195","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Flexible statistical methods for estimating and testing effects in genomic studies with multiple conditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0268-8","volume":"51"},

The consequences of polyploidization are complex and variable, and they differ greatly between systems (clonal or non-clonal) and species, but the process has often been considered to be an evolutionary ‘dead end’. Here, we review the accumulating evidence that correlates polyploidization with environmental change or stress, and that has led to an increased recognition of its short-term adaptive potential. In addition, we discuss how, once polyploidy has been established, the unique retention profile of duplicated genes following whole-genome duplication might explain key longer-term evolutionary transitions and a general increase in biological complexity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Van de Peer","given":"Yves"},{"family":"Mizrachi","given":"Eshchar"},{"family":"Marchal","given":"Kathleen"}],"container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Genet","DOI":"10.1038/nrg.2017.26","ISSN":"1471-0056, 1471-0064","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7]]},"language":"en","page":"411-424","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The evolutionary significance of polyploidy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.26","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"vanraden2008","abstract":"Efficient methods for processing genomic data were developed to increase reliability of estimated breeding values and to estimate thousands of marker effects simultaneously. Algorithms were derived and computer programs tested with simulated data for 2,967 bulls and 50,000 markers distributed randomly across 30 chromosomes. Estimation of genomic inbreeding coefficients required accurate estimates of allele frequencies in the base population. Linear model predictions of breeding values were computed by 3 equivalent methods: 1) iteration for individual allele effects followed by summation across loci to obtain estimated breeding values, 2) selection index including a genomic relationship matrix, and 3) mixed model equations including the inverse of genomic relationships. A blend of first- and second-order Jacobi iteration using 2 separate relaxation factors converged well for allele frequencies and effects. Reliability of predicted net merit for young bulls was 63% compared with 32% using the traditional relationship matrix. Nonlinear predictions were also computed using iteration on data and nonlinear regression on marker deviations; an additional (about 3%) gain in reliability for young bulls increased average reliability to 66%. Computing times increased linearly with number of genotypes. Estimation of allele frequencies required 2 processor days, and genomic predictions required <1 d per trait, and traits were processed in parallel. Information from genotyping was equivalent to about 20 daughters with phenotypic records. Actual gains may differ because the simulation did not account for linkage disequilibrium in the base population or selection in subsequent generations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"VanRaden","given":"P.

  {"id":"vierstra2020","abstract":"Combinatorial binding of transcription factors to regulatory DNA underpins gene regulation in all organisms. Genetic variation in regulatory regions has been connected with diseases and diverse phenotypic traits1, but it remains challenging to distinguish variants that affect regulatory function2. Genomic DNase I footprinting enables the quantitative, nucleotide-resolution delineation of sites of transcription factor occupancy within native chromatin3–6. However, only a small fraction of such sites have been precisely resolved on the human genome sequence6. Here, to enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from 243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these data to delineate about 4.5 million compact genomic elements that encode transcription factor occupancy at nucleotide resolution. We map the fine-scale structure within about 1.6 million DNase I-hypersensitive sites and show that the overwhelming majority are populated by well-spaced sites of single transcription factor–DNA interaction. Cell-context-dependent cis-regulation is chiefly executed by wholesale modulation of accessibility at regulatory DNA rather than by differential transcription factor occupancy within accessible elements. We also show that the enrichment of genetic variants associated with diseases or phenotypic traits in regulatory regions1,7 is almost entirely attributable to variants within footprints, and that functional variants that affect transcription factor occupancy are nearly evenly partitioned between loss- and gain-of-function alleles. Unexpectedly, we find increased density of human genetic variation within transcription factor footprints, revealing an unappreciated driver of cis-regulatory evolution. Our results provide a framework for both global and nucleotide-precision analyses of gene regulatory mechanisms and functional genetic variation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Vierstra","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Lazar","given":"John"},{"family":"Sandstrom","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Halow","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Kristen"},{"family":"Bates","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Diegel","given":"Morgan"},{"family":"Dunn","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Neri","given":"Fidencio"},{"family":"Haugen","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Rynes","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Jemma"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Audra"},{"family":"Frerker","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Buckley","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Kaul","given":"Rajinder"},{"family":"Meuleman","given":"Wouter"},{"family":"Stamatoyannopoulos","given":"John A."}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2528-x","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7818","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"language":"en","number":"7818","page":"729-736","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Global reference mapping of human transcription factor footprints","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2528-x","volume":"583"},

  {"id":"walkowiak2020","abstract":"Advances in genomics have expedited the improvement of several agriculturally important crops but similar efforts in wheat (Triticum spp.) have been more challenging. This is largely owing to the size and complexity of the wheat genome1, and the lack of genome-assembly data for multiple wheat lines2,3. Here we generated ten chromosome pseudomolecule and five scaffold assemblies of hexaploid wheat to explore the genomic diversity among wheat lines from global breeding programs. Comparative analysis revealed extensive structural rearrangements, introgressions from wild relatives and differences in gene content resulting from complex breeding histories aimed at improving adaptation to diverse environments, grain yield and quality, and resistance to stresses4,5. We provide examples outlining the utility of these genomes, including a detailed multi-genome-derived nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein repertoire involved in disease resistance and the characterization of Sm16, a gene associated with insect resistance. These genome assemblies will provide a basis for functional gene discovery and breeding to deliver the next generation of modern wheat cultivars.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Walkowiak","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Liangliang"},{"family":"Monat","given":"Cecile"},{"family":"Haberer","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Kassa","given":"Mulualem T."},{"family":"Brinton","given":"Jemima"},{"family":"Ramirez-Gonzalez","given":"Ricardo H."},{"family":"Kolodziej","given":"Markus C."},{"family":"Delorean","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Thambugala","given":"Dinushika"},{"family":"Klymiuk","given":"Valentyna"},{"family":"Byrns","given":"Brook"},{"family":"Gundlach","given":"Heidrun"},{"family":"Bandi","given":"Venkat"},{"family":"Siri","given":"Jorge Nunez"},{"family":"Nilsen","given":"Kirby"},{"family":"Aquino","given":"Catharine"},{"family":"Himmelbach","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Copetti","given":"Dario"},{"family":"Ban","given":"Tomohiro"},{"family":"Venturini","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Bevan","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Clavijo","given":"Bernardo"},{"family":"Koo","given":"Dal-Hoe"},{"family":"Ens","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Wiebe","given":"Krystalee"},{"family":"N’Diaye","given":"Amidou"},{"family":"Fritz","given":"Allen K."},{"family":"Gutwin","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Fiebig","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Fosker","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Bin Xiao"},{"family":"Accinelli","given":"Gonzalo Garcia"},{"family":"Gardner","given":"Keith A."},{"family":"Fradgley","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Gutierrez-Gonzalez","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Halstead-Nussloch","given":"Gwyneth"},{"family":"Hatakeyama","given":"Masaomi"},{"family":"Koh","given":"Chu Shin"},{"family":"Deek","given":"Jasline"},{"family":"Costamagna","given":"Alejandro C."},{"family":"Fobert","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Heavens","given":"Darren"},{"family":"Kanamori","given":"Hiroyuki"},{"family":"Kawaura","given":"Kanako"},{"family":"Kobayashi","given":"Fuminori"},{"family":"Krasileva","given":"Ksenia"},{"family":"Kuo","given":"Tony"},{"family":"McKenzie","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Murata","given":"Kazuki"},{"family":"Nabeka","given":"Yusuke"},{"family":"Paape","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Padmarasu","given":"Sudharsan"},{"family":"Percival-Alwyn","given":"Lawrence"},{"family":"Kagale","given":"Sateesh"},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Sese","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Juliana","given":"Philomin"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Ravi"},{"family":"Shimizu-Inatsugi","given":"Rie"},{"family":"Swarbreck","given":"David"},{"family":"Cockram","given":"James"},{"family":"Budak","given":"Hikmet"},{"family":"Tameshige","given":"Toshiaki"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Tsuyoshi"},{"family":"Tsuji","given":"Hiroyuki"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jianzhong"},{"family":"Steuernagel","given":"Burkhard"},{"family":"Small","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Cloutier","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Keeble-Gagnère","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Muehlbauer","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Tibbets","given":"Josquin"},{"family":"Nasuda","given":"Shuhei"},{"family":"Melonek","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Hucl","given":"Pierre J."},{"family":"Sharpe","given":"Andrew G."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Legg","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Bharti","given":"Arvind"},{"family":"Langridge","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Uauy","given":"Cristobal"},{"family":"Mascher","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Krattinger","given":"Simon G."},{"family":"Handa","given":"Hirokazu"},{"family":"Shimizu","given":"Kentaro K."},{"family":"Distelfeld","given":"Assaf"},{"family":"Chalmers","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Beat"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Klaus F.

  {"id":"wallace2021a","abstract":"In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) it is now common to search for, and find, multiple causal variants located in close proximity. It has also become standard to ask whether different traits share the same causal variants, but one of the popular methods to answer this question, coloc, makes the simplifying assumption that only a single causal variant exists for any given trait in any genomic region. Here, we examine the potential of the recently proposed Sum of Single Effects (SuSiE) regression framework, which can be used for fine-mapping genetic signals, for use with coloc. SuSiE is a novel approach that allows evidence for association at multiple causal variants to be evaluated simultaneously, whilst separating the statistical support for each variant conditional on the causal signal being considered. We show this results in more accurate coloc inference than other proposals to adapt coloc for multiple causal variants based on conditioning. We therefore recommend that coloc be used in combination with SuSiE to optimise accuracy of colocalisation analyses when multiple causal variants exist.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wallace","given":"Chris"}],"container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1009440","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]]},"language":"en","page":"e1009440","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"A more accurate method for colocalisation analysis allowing for multiple causal variants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009440","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"wang1999","abstract":"A new methodology based on mixed linear models was developed for mapping QTLs with digenic epistasis and QTL×environment (QE) interactions. Reliable estimates of QTL main effects (additive and epistasis effects) can be obtained by the maximum-likelihood estimation method, while QE interaction effects (additive×environment interaction and epistasis×environment interaction) can be predicted by the-best-linear-unbiased-prediction (BLUP) method. Likelihood ratio and t statistics were combined for testing hypotheses about QTL effects and QE interactions. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted for evaluating the unbiasedness, accuracy, and power for parameter estimation in QTL mapping. The results indicated that the mixed-model approaches could provide unbiased estimates for both positions and effects of QTLs, as well as unbiased predicted values for QE interactions. Additionally, the mixed-model approaches also showed high accuracy and power in mapping QTLs with epistatic effects and QE interactions. Based on the models and the methodology, a computer software program (QTLMapper version 1.0) was developed, which is suitable for interval mapping of QTLs with additive, additive×additive epistasis, and their environment interactions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"D.

  {"id":"wang2009","abstract":"Rapid increase in the availability of fine-scale genetic marker maps has led to the intensive use of QTL mapping in the genetic study of quantitative traits. Composite interval mapping (CIM) is one of the most commonly used methods for QTL mapping with populations derived from biparental crosses. However, the algorithm used in CIM cannot completely ensure that the effect of QTL at current testing interval is not absorbed by the background marker variables, and may result in biased estimation of QTL effect. We proposed a statistical method for QTL mapping, which was called inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM). Two steps were included in ICIM. In the first step, stepwise regression was applied to identify the most significant regression variables. In the second step, a one-dimensional scanning or interval mapping was conducted for detecting additive (and dominance) QTL and a two-dimensional scanning was conducted for detecting digenic epistasis. ICIM provides intuitive statistics for testing additive, dominance and epistasis, and can be used for most experimental populations derived from two inbred parental lines. The EM algorithm used in ICIM has a fast convergence speed and is therefore less computing intensive. ICIM retains all advantages of CIM over interval mapping, and avoids the possible increase of sampling variance and the complicated background marker selection process in CIM. A doubled haploid (DH) population in barley was used to demonstrate the application of ICIM in mapping additive QTL and additive by additive interacting QTL.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jian-Kang"}],"container-title":"ACTA AGRONOMICA SINICA","container-title-short":"A A S","DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1006.2009.00239","ISSN":"0496-3490","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,5,6]]},"language":"zh","page":"239-245","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Inclusive Composite Interval Mapping of Quantitative Trait Genes: Inclusive Composite Interval Mapping of Quantitative Trait Genes","title-short":"Inclusive Composite Interval Mapping of Quantitative Trait Genes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://pub.chinasciencejournal.com/article/getArticleRedirect.action?doiCode=10.3724/SP.J.1006.2009.00239","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"wang2016","abstract":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used in genetic dissection of complex traits. However, common methods are all based on a fixed-SNP-effect mixed linear model (MLM) and single marker analysis, such as efficient mixed model analysis (EMMA). These methods require Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, which often is too conservative when the number of markers is extremely large. To address this concern, we proposed a random-SNP-effect MLM (RMLM) and a multi-locus RMLM (MRMLM) for GWAS. The RMLM simply treats the SNP-effect as random, but it allows a modified Bonferroni correction to be used to calculate the threshold p value for significance tests. The MRMLM is a multi-locus model including markers selected from the RMLM method with a less stringent selection criterion. Due to the multi-locus nature, no multiple test correction is needed. Simulation studies show that the MRMLM is more powerful in QTN detection and more accurate in QTN effect estimation than the RMLM, which in turn is more powerful and accurate than the EMMA. To demonstrate the new methods, we analyzed six flowering time related traits in Arabidopsis thaliana and detected more genes than previous reported using the EMMA. Therefore, the MRMLM provides an alternative for multi-locus GWAS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Shi-Bo"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Jian-Ying"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Wen-Long"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Yang-Jun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jin"},{"family":"Dunwell","given":"Jim M."},{"family":"Xu","given":"Shizhong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuan-Ming"}],"container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/srep19444","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,20]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"19444","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Improving power and accuracy of genome-wide association studies via a multi-locus mixed linear model methodology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19444","volume":"6"},

For crops, this translates into lower yield when plant immunity is activated.

Thus, both pathogen defense and crop yield can be sustained.\nScience, this issue p. 1026; see also p. 976\nPlant immunity often penalizes growth and yield. The transcription factor Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1) reduces unproductive tillers and increases grains per panicle, which results in improved rice yield. Here we report that higher IPA1 levels enhance immunity. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of IPA1 at amino acid Ser163 within its DNA binding domain occurs in response to infection by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and alters the DNA binding specificity of IPA1. Phosphorylated IPA1 binds to the promoter of the pathogen defense gene WRKY45 and activates its expression, leading to enhanced disease resistance. IPA1 returns to a nonphosphorylated state within 48 hours after infection, resuming support of the growth needed for high yield. Thus, IPA1 promotes both yield and disease resistance by sustaining a balance between growth and immunity.\nA transcription factor that builds a high-yielding rice plant also supports immune responses.\nA transcription factor that builds a high-yielding rice plant also supports immune responses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Lian"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Chern","given":"Mawsheng"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Hong"},{"family":"He","given":"Min"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Junjie"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xiaobo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Weitao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jiali"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jichun"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiaoqiong"},{"family":"Qing","given":"Hai"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuping"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Guifu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wenming"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xianjun"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Lihuang"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Jian-Min"},{"family":"Ronald","given":"Pamela C."},{"family":"Li","given":"Shigui"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiayang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xuewei"}],"container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aat7675","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6406","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,7]]},"language":"en","page":"1026-1028","PMID":"30190406","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Report","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"A single transcription factor promotes both yield and immunity in rice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6406/1026","volume":"361"},
  {"id":"wang2018c","abstract":"Gene expression regulation plays an important role in controlling plant phenotypes and adaptation. Here, we report a comprehensive assessment of gene expression variation through the transcriptome analyses of a large maize-teosinte experimental population. Genome-wide mapping identiﬁed 25 660 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for 17 311 genes, capturing an unprecedented range of expression variation. We found that local eQTL were more frequently mapped to adjacent genes, displaying a mode of expression piggybacking, which consequently created co-regulated gene clusters. Genes within the co-regulated gene clusters tend to have relevant functions and shared chromatin modiﬁcations. Distant eQTL formed 125 signiﬁcant distant eQTL hotspots with their targets signiﬁcantly enriched in speciﬁc functional categories. By integrating different sources of information, we identiﬁed putative trans- regulators for a variety of metabolic pathways. We demonstrated that the bHLH transcription factor R1 and hexokinase HEX9 might act as crucial regulators for ﬂavonoid biosynthesis and glycolysis, respectively. Moreover, we showed that domestication or improvement has signiﬁcantly affected global gene expression, with many genes targeted by selection. Of particular interest, the Bx genes for benzoxazinoid biosynthesis may have undergone coordinated cis-regulatory divergence between maize and teosinte, and a transposon insertion that inactivates Bx12 was under strong selection as maize spread into temperate environments with a distinct herbivore community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Xufeng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Qiuyue"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yaoyao"},{"family":"Lemmon","given":"Zachary H."},{"family":"Xu","given":"Guanghui"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yameng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Dingyi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Doebley","given":"John F."},{"family":"Tian","given":"Feng"}],"container-title":"Molecular Plant","container-title-short":"Molecular Plant","DOI":"10.1016/j.molp.2017.12.011","ISSN":"16742052","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3]]},"language":"en","page":"443-459","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Genome-wide Analysis of Transcriptional Variability in a Large Maize-Teosinte Population","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1674205217303817","volume":"11"},

Here, we propose a method to measure tumor immunogenicity score (TIGS), which combines tumor mutational burden (TMB) and an expression signature of the antigen processing and presenting machinery (APM). In both correlation with pan-cancer ICI objective response rates (ORR) and ICI clinical response prediction for individual patients, TIGS consistently showed improved performance compared to TMB and other known prediction biomarkers for ICI response.

  {"id":"wang2020b","abstract":"We have developed a rapid mixed model algorithm for exhaustive genome-wide epistatic association analysis by controlling multiple polygenic effects. Our model can simultaneously handle additive by additive epistasis, dominance by dominance epistasis and additive by dominance epistasis, and account for intrasubject fluctuations due to individuals with repeated records. Furthermore, we suggest a simple but efficient approximate algorithm, which allows the examination of all pairwise interactions in a remarkably fast manner of linear with population size.

  {"id":"wang2020c","abstract":"In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) is required for the formation of transposable element (TE)-derived small RNA transcripts. These transcripts are processed by DICER-LIKE3 into 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide RNA-directed DNA methylation. In the pollen grain, Pol IV is also required for the accumulation of 21/22-nucleotide epigenetically activated siRNAs, which likely silence TEs via post-transcriptional mechanisms. Despite this proposed role of Pol IV, its loss of function in Arabidopsis does not cause a discernible pollen defect. Here, we show that the knockout of NRPD1, encoding the largest subunit of Pol IV, in the Brassicaceae species Capsella (Capsella rubella), caused postmeiotic arrest of pollen development at the microspore stage. As in Arabidopsis, all TE-derived siRNAs were depleted in Capsella nrpd1 microspores. In the wild-type background, the same TEs produced 21/22-nucleotide and 24-nucleotide siRNAs; these processes required Pol IV activity. Arrest of Capsella nrpd1 microspores was accompanied by the deregulation of genes targeted by Pol IV-dependent siRNAs. TEs were much closer to genes in Capsella compared with Arabidopsis, perhaps explaining the essential role of Pol IV in pollen development in Capsella. Our discovery that Pol IV is functionally required in Capsella microspores emphasizes the relevance of investigating different plant models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhenxing"},{"family":"Butel","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Santos-González","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Borges","given":"Filipe"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Martienssen","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Martinez","given":"German"},{"family":"Köhler","given":"Claudia"}],"container-title":"The Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1105/tpc.19.00938","ISSN":"1040-4651, 1532-298X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"950-966","PMID":"31988265","publisher":"American Society of Plant Biologists","section":"Research Article","source":"www.plantcell.org","title":"Polymerase IV Plays a Crucial Role in Pollen Development in Capsella","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.plantcell.org/content/32/4/950","volume":"32"},
  {"id":"wang2020d","abstract":"Plant hormones known as strigolactones control plant development and interactions between host plants and symbiotic fungi or parasitic weeds1–4. In Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, the proteins DWARF14 (D14), MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2), SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2-LIKE 6, 7 and 8 (SMXL6, SMXL7 and SMXL8) and their orthologues form a complex upon strigolactone perception and play a central part in strigolactone signalling5–10. However, whether and how strigolactones activate downstream transcription remains largely unknown. Here we use a synthetic strigolactone to identify 401 strigolactone-responsive genes in Arabidopsis, and show that these plant hormones regulate shoot branching, leaf shape and anthocyanin accumulation mainly through transcriptional activation of the BRANCHED 1, TCP DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 and PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT 1 genes. We find that SMXL6 targets 729 genes in the Arabidopsis genome and represses the transcription of SMXL6, SMXL7 and SMXL8 by binding directly to their promoters, showing that SMXL6 serves as an autoregulated transcription factor to maintain the homeostasis of strigolactone signalling. These findings reveal an unanticipated mechanism through which a transcriptional repressor of hormone signalling can directly recognize DNA and regulate transcription in higher plants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Hongyan"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Kou","given":"Liquan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Anqi"},{"family":"Shao","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Haiyan"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Guosheng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaoqiang"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Jinfang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiayang"}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2382-x","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7815","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Plant signalling;Strigolactone\nSubject_term_id: plant-signalling;strigolactone","number":"7815","page":"277-281","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Transcriptional regulation of strigolactone signalling in Arabidopsis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2382-x","volume":"583"},

The three-dimensional structure of the genome is intricately linked to gene expression, but its role in transcription regulation following polyploidy and domestication remains unclear. Here, we generated high-resolution (∼2 kb) Hi-C maps for cultivated soybean (Glycine max), wild soybean (Glycine soja) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). We found polyploidization in soybean may induce architecture changes of topologically associating domains and subsequent diploidization led to chromatin topology alteration around chromosome-rearrangement sites. Compared with single-copy and small-scale duplicated genes, WGD genes displayed more long-range chromosomal interactions and were coupled with higher levels of gene expression and chromatin accessibilities but void of DNA methylation. Interestingly, chromatin loop reorganization was involved in expression divergence of the genes during soybean domestication. Genes with chromatin loops were under stronger artificial selection than genes without loops. These findings provide insights into roles of dynamic chromatin structures on gene expression during polyploidization, diploidization and domestication of soybean.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Longfei"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Guanghong"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Xinyu"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Z.

  {"id":"wen2016","abstract":"Mapping molecular QTLs has emerged as an important tool for understanding the genetic basis of cell functions. With the increasing availability of functional genomic data, it is natural to incorporate genomic annotations into QTL discovery. Discovering molecular QTLs is typically framed as a multiple hypothesis testing problem and solved using false discovery rate (FDR) control procedures. Currently, most existing statistical approaches rely on obtaining $p$-values for each candidate locus through permutation-based schemes, which are not only inconvenient for incorporating highly informative genomic annotations but also computationally inefficient. In this paper, we discuss a novel statistical approach for integrative QTL discovery based on the theoretical framework of Bayesian FDR control. We use a Bayesian hierarchical model to naturally integrate genomic annotations into molecular QTL mapping and propose an empirical Bayes-based computational procedure to approximate the necessary posterior probabilities to achieve high computational efficiency. Through theoretical arguments and simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed approach rigorously controls the desired type I error rate and greatly improves the power of QTL discovery when incorporating informative annotations. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by analyzing the expression-genotype data from 44 human tissues generated by the GTEx project. By integrating the simple annotation of SNP distance to transcription start sites, we discover more genes that harbor expression-associated SNPs in all 44 tissues, with an average increase of 1485 genes per tissue.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wen","given":"Xiaoquan"}],"container-title":"The Annals of Applied Statistics","DOI":"10.1214/16-AOAS952","ISSN":"1932-6157, 1941-7330","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9]]},"page":"1619-1638","publisher":"Institute of Mathematical Statistics","source":"Project Euclid","title":"Molecular QTL discovery incorporating genomic annotations using Bayesian false discovery rate control","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-10/issue-3/Molecular-QTL-discovery-incorporating-genomic-annotations-using-Bayesian-false-discovery/10.1214/16-AOAS952.full","volume":"10"},

In this study, variation in the maternally inherited chloroplast genome was assessed among species representing both of the parental genomes and the tetraploids. Approximately 560 restriction sites were assayed in each accession, representing sequence information for about 3200 nucleotides. The resulting maternal phylogeny has no convergent restriction site mutations and demonstrates that the cytoplasm donor for all tetraploid species was an A genome diploid with a chloroplast genome that is similar to Gossypium arboreum and Gossypium herbaceum. No mutational differences were detected between these two species, and few mutations distinguish the chloroplast genomes of A genome diploids from those of tetraploid taxa. In contrast to expectations based on extensive taxonomic, geographic, and genetic diversity, a surprisingly low level of sequence divergence has accumulated subsequent to polyploidization. Chloroplast genomes of tetraploid species are distinguished from each other by between one and six apparent point mutations.

  {"id":"west2007","abstract":"The genetic architecture of transcript-level variation is largely unknown. The genetic determinants of transcript-level variation were characterized in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (n = 211) of Arabidopsis thaliana using whole-genome microarray analysis and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping of transcript levels as expression traits (e-traits). Genetic control of transcription was highly complex: one-third of the quantitatively controlled transcripts/e-traits were regulated by cis-eQTL, and many trans-eQTL mapped to hotspots that regulated hundreds to thousands of e-traits. Several thousand eQTL of large phenotypic effect were detected, but almost all (93%) of the 36,871 eQTL were associated with small phenotypic effects (R2 < 0.3). Many transcripts/e-traits were controlled by multiple eQTL with opposite allelic effects and exhibited higher heritability in the RILs than their parents, suggesting nonadditive genetic variation. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale global eQTL study in a relatively large plant mapping population. It reveals that the genetic control of transcript level is highly variable and multifaceted and that this complexity may be a general characteristic of eukaryotes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"West","given":"Marilyn A.

  {"id":"wgsc2018","abstract":"Insights from the annotated wheat genome\nWheat is one of the major sources of food for much of the world. However, because bread wheat's genome is a large hybrid mix of three separate subgenomes, it has been difficult to produce a high-quality reference sequence. Using recent advances in sequencing, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium presents an annotated reference genome with a detailed analysis of gene content among subgenomes and the structural organization for all the chromosomes. Examples of quantitative trait mapping and CRISPR-based genome modification show the potential for using this genome in agricultural research and breeding. Ramírez-González et al. exploited the fruits of this endeavor to identify tissue-specific biased gene expression and coexpression networks during development and exposure to stress. These resources will accelerate our understanding of the genetic basis of bread wheat.\nScience, this issue p. eaar7191; see also p. eaar6089\nStructured Abstract\nINTRODUCTIONWheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most widely cultivated crop on Earth, contributing about a fifth of the total calories consumed by humans. Consequently, wheat yields and production affect the global economy, and failed harvests can lead to social unrest. Breeders continuously strive to develop improved varieties by fine-tuning genetically complex yield and end-use quality parameters while maintaining stable yields and adapting the crop to regionally specific biotic and abiotic stresses.\nRATIONALEBreeding efforts are limited by insufficient knowledge and understanding of wheat biology and the molecular basis of central agronomic traits. To meet the demands of human population growth, there is an urgent need for wheat research and breeding to accelerate genetic gain as well as to increase and protect wheat yield and quality traits. In other plant and animal species, access to a fully annotated and ordered genome sequence, including regulatory sequences and genome-diversity information, has promoted the development of systematic and more time-efficient approaches for the selection and understanding of important traits. Wheat has lagged behind, primarily owing to the challenges of assembling a genome that is more than five times as large as the human genome, polyploid, and complex, containing more than 85% repetitive DNA. To provide a foundation for improvement through molecular breeding, in 2005, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium set out to deliver a high-quality annotated reference genome sequence of bread wheat.\nRESULTSAn annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in the form of 21 chromosome-like sequence assemblies has now been delivered, giving access to 107,891 high-confidence genes, including their genomic context of regulatory sequences. This assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage–related gene coexpression networks using a transcriptome atlas representing all stages of wheat development. The dynamics of change in complex gene families involved in environmental adaptation and end-use quality were revealed at subgenome resolution and contextualized to known agronomic single-gene or quantitative trait loci. Aspects of the future value of the annotated assembly for molecular breeding and research were exemplarily illustrated by resolving the genetic basis of a quantitative trait locus conferring resistance to abiotic stress and insect damage as well as by serving as the basis for genome editing of the flowering-time trait.\nCONCLUSIONThis annotated reference sequence of wheat is a resource that can now drive disruptive innovation in wheat improvement, as this community resource establishes the foundation for accelerating wheat research and application through improved understanding of wheat biology and genomics-assisted breeding. Importantly, the bioinformatics capacity developed for model-organism genomes will facilitate a better understanding of the wheat genome as a result of the high-quality chromosome-based genome assembly. By necessity, breeders work with the genome at the whole chromosome level, as each new cross involves the modification of genome-wide gene networks that control the expression of complex traits such as yield. With the annotated and ordered reference genome sequence in place, researchers and breeders can now easily access sequence-level information to precisely define the necessary changes in the genomes for breeding programs. This will be realized through the implementation of new DNA marker platforms and targeted breeding technologies, including genome editing. <img class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\" src=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6403/eaar7191/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Wheat genome deciphered, assembled, and ordered.Seeds, or grains, are what counts with respect to wheat yields (left panel), but all parts of the plant contribute to crop performance. With complete access to the ordered sequence of all 21 wheat chromosomes, the context of regulatory sequences, and the interaction network of expressed genes—all shown here as a circular plot (right panel) with concentric tracks for diverse aspects of wheat genome composition—breeders and researchers now have the ability to rewrite the story of wheat crop improvement. Details on value ranges underlying the concentric heatmaps of the right panel are provided in the full article online.\nAn annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in 21 pseudomolecules has been analyzed to identify the distribution and genomic context of coding and noncoding elements across the A, B, and D subgenomes. With an estimated coverage of 94% of the genome and containing 107,891 high-confidence gene models, this assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage–related coexpression networks by providing a transcriptome atlas representing major stages of wheat development. Dynamics of complex gene families involved in environmental adaptation and end-use quality were revealed at subgenome resolution and contextualized to known agronomic single-gene or quantitative trait loci. This community resource establishes the foundation for accelerating wheat research and application through improved understanding of wheat biology and genomics-assisted breeding.\nThe 21 annotated chromosomes of bread wheat provide a foundation for innovation in research and breeding.\nThe 21 annotated chromosomes of bread wheat provide a foundation for innovation in research and breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Consortium (IWGSC)","given":"The International Wheat Genome Sequencing"},{"family":"Appels","given":"Rudi"},{"family":"Eversole","given":"Kellye"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Feuillet","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Beat"},{"family":"Rogers","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Pozniak","given":"Curtis J."},{"family":"Choulet","given":"Frédéric"},{"family":"Distelfeld","given":"Assaf"},{"family":"Poland","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Ronen","given":"Gil"},{"family":"Sharpe","given":"Andrew G."},{"family":"Barad","given":"Omer"},{"family":"Baruch","given":"Kobi"},{"family":"Keeble-Gagnère","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Mascher","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Ben-Zvi","given":"Gil"},{"family":"Josselin","given":"Ambre-Aurore"},{"family":"Himmelbach","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Balfourier","given":"François"},{"family":"Gutierrez-Gonzalez","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Hayden","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Koh","given":"ChuShin"},{"family":"Muehlbauer","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Pasam","given":"Raj K."},{"family":"Paux","given":"Etienne"},{"family":"Rigault","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Tibbits","given":"Josquin"},{"family":"Tiwari","given":"Vijay"},{"family":"Spannagl","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Gundlach","given":"Heidrun"},{"family":"Haberer","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Klaus F.

  {"id":"whiffin2020","abstract":"Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are tissue-specific cis-regulators of protein translation. Isolated reports have shown that variants that create or disrupt uORFs can cause disease. Here, in a systematic genome-wide study using 15,708 whole genome sequences, we show that variants that create new upstream start codons, and variants disrupting stop sites of existing uORFs, are under strong negative selection. This selection signal is significantly stronger for variants arising upstream of genes intolerant to loss-of-function variants. Furthermore, variants creating uORFs that overlap the coding sequence show signals of selection equivalent to coding missense variants. Finally, we identify specific genes where modification of uORFs likely represents an important disease mechanism, and report a novel uORF frameshift variant upstream of NF2 in neurofibromatosis. Our results highlight uORF-perturbing variants as an under-recognised functional class that contribute to penetrant human disease, and demonstrate the power of large-scale population sequencing data in studying non-coding variant classes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Whiffin","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Karczewski","given":"Konrad J."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaolei"},{"family":"Chothani","given":"Sonia"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Miriam J."},{"family":"Evans","given":"D.

So far, a major focus of BCI research has been on restoring gross motor skills, such as reaching and grasping1–5 or point-and-click typing with a computer cursor6,7. However, rapid sequences of highly dexterous behaviours, such as handwriting or touch typing, might enable faster rates of communication. Here we developed an intracortical BCI that decodes attempted handwriting movements from neural activity in the motor cortex and translates it to text in real time, using a recurrent neural network decoding approach. With this BCI, our study participant, whose hand was paralysed from spinal cord injury, achieved typing speeds of 90 characters per minute with 94.1% raw accuracy online, and greater than 99% accuracy offline with a general-purpose autocorrect. To our knowledge, these typing speeds exceed those reported for any other BCI, and are comparable to typical smartphone typing speeds of individuals in the age group of our participant (115 characters per minute)8. Finally, theoretical considerations explain why temporally complex movements, such as handwriting, may be fundamentally easier to decode than point-to-point movements. Our results open a new approach for BCIs and demonstrate the feasibility of accurately decoding rapid, dexterous movements years after paralysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Willett","given":"Francis R."},{"family":"Avansino","given":"Donald T."},{"family":"Hochberg","given":"Leigh R."},{"family":"Henderson","given":"Jaimie M."},{"family":"Shenoy","given":"Krishna V."}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03506-2","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7858","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5]]},"language":"en","number":"7858","page":"249-254","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"High-performance brain-to-text communication via handwriting","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03506-2","volume":"593"},

Here, we show that removal of microglia from the mouse brain has little effect on the outcome of TBI, but inducing the turnover of these cells through either pharmacologic or genetic approaches can yield a neuroprotective microglial phenotype that profoundly aids recovery. The beneficial effects of these repopulating microglia are critically dependent on interleukin-6 (IL-6) trans-signaling via the soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and robustly support adult neurogenesis, specifically by augmenting the survival of newborn neurons that directly support cognitive function. We conclude that microglia in the mammalian brain can be manipulated to adopt a neuroprotective and pro-regenerative phenotype that can aid repair and alleviate the cognitive deficits arising from brain injury.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Willis","given":"Emily F."},{"family":"MacDonald","given":"Kelli P.

However, the 3D organization of chromosomes during human brain development and its role in regulating gene networks dysregulated in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or schizophrenia4,5,6, are unknown. Here we generate high-resolution 3D maps of chromatin contacts during human corticogenesis, permitting large-scale annotation of previously uncharacterized regulatory relationships relevant to the evolution of human cognition and disease. Our analyses identify hundreds of genes that physically interact with enhancers gained on the human lineage, many of which are under purifying selection and associated with human cognitive function. We integrate chromatin contacts with non-coding variants identified in schizophrenia genome-wide association studies (GWAS), highlighting multiple candidate schizophrenia risk genes and pathways, including transcription factors involved in neurogenesis, and cholinergic signalling molecules, several of which are supported by independent expression quantitative trait loci and gene expression analyses. Genome editing in human neural progenitors suggests that one of these distal schizophrenia GWAS loci regulates FOXG1 expression, supporting its potential role as a schizophrenia risk gene.

  {"id":"wu2021","abstract":"Grain number per panicle (GNP) is an important agronomic trait that contributes to rice grain yield. Despite its importance in rice breeding, the molecular mechanism underlying GNP regulation remains largely unknown. Here, we report that genetic variation in the CArG box-containing inverted repeat (IR) sequence of OsREM20 promoter alters its expression level and contributes to GNP variation among rice varieties through genetic analysis and transgenic validation. We revealed that the IR sequence regulates OsREM20 expression by affecting the direct binding of OsMADS34 to the CArG box within the IR sequence. The divergent pOsREM20IR and pOsREM20ΔIR alleles originated from different O. rufipogon accessions, and were independently inherited into the japonica and indica subspecies respectively during domestication. We further determined that IR sequence variations in the OsREM20 promoter can be utilized for germplasm improvement through either genome editing or traditional breeding. Our findings highlight exciting implications not only for characterizing the novel genetic variation that responsible for GNP diversity in rice, but also for revealing the molecular mechanism and potential application of the cis-regulatory element-containing IR sequence in the regulation of agronomically important gene expression.","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Xiaowei"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Hengbin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiyao"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Hua","given":"Lekai"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Yundong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ahong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaohui"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jiafan"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Meng","given":"Xiangbing"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Dahan"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Shaoyang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Xuehui"},{"family":"Han","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiayang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yonghong"}],"container-title":"Molecular Plant","container-title-short":"Mol Plant","DOI":"10.1016/j.molp.2021.03.016","ISSN":"1752-9867","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,16]]},"language":"eng","PMID":"33741527","source":"PubMed","title":"Enhancing Rice Grain Production by Manipulating naturally Evolved cis-Regulatory Element-Containing Inverted Repeat Sequence of OsREM20","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"wu2021a","abstract":"Defects in DNA repair frequently lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the particular importance of DNA repair in long-lived post-mitotic neurons1,2. The cellular genome is subjected to a constant barrage of endogenous DNA damage, but surprisingly little is known about the identity of the lesion(s) that accumulate in neurons and whether they accrue throughout the genome or at specific loci. Here we show that post-mitotic neurons accumulate unexpectedly high levels of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) at specific sites within the genome. Genome-wide mapping reveals that SSBs are located within enhancers at or near CpG dinucleotides and sites of DNA demethylation. These SSBs are repaired by PARP1 and XRCC1-dependent mechanisms. Notably, deficiencies in XRCC1-dependent short-patch repair increase DNA repair synthesis at neuronal enhancers, whereas defects in long-patch repair reduce synthesis. The high levels of SSB repair in neuronal enhancers are therefore likely to be sustained by both short-patch and long-patch processes. These data provide the first evidence of site- and cell-type-specific SSB repair, revealing unexpected levels of localized and continuous DNA breakage in neurons. In addition, they suggest an explanation for the neurodegenerative phenotypes that occur in patients with defective SSB repair.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Sarah E."},{"family":"Nathan","given":"William J."},{"family":"Paiano","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Callen","given":"Elsa"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Dongpeng"},{"family":"Shinoda","given":"Kenta"},{"family":"Wietmarschen","given":"Niek","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Colón-Mercado","given":"Jennifer M."},{"family":"Zong","given":"Dali"},{"family":"De Pace","given":"Raffaella"},{"family":"Shih","given":"Han-Yu"},{"family":"Coon","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Parsadanian","given":"Maia"},{"family":"Pavani","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"Hanzlikova","given":"Hana"},{"family":"Park","given":"Solji"},{"family":"Jung","given":"Seol Kyoung"},{"family":"McHugh","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Canela","given":"Andres"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Chongyi"},{"family":"Casellas","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Caldecott","given":"Keith W."},{"family":"Ward","given":"Michael E."},{"family":"Nussenzweig","given":"André"}],"container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03468-5","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7859","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5]]},"language":"en","number":"7859","page":"440-444","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Neuronal enhancers are hotspots for DNA single-strand break repair","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03468-5","volume":"593"},

We used 10 different recombination inbred line (RIL) populations genotyped with high-density markers and phenotyped in multiple environments to dissect the genetic architecture of maize ear traits. Three methods were used to map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting ear traits. We found 17–34 minor- or moderate-effect loci that influence ear traits, with little epistasis and environmental interactions, totally accounting for 55.4–82% of the phenotypic variation. Four novel QTLs were validated and fine mapped using candidate gene association analysis, expression QTL analysis and heterogeneous inbred family validation. The combination of multiple different populations is a flexible and manageable way to collaboratively integrate widely available genetic resources, thereby boosting the statistical power of QTL discovery for important traits in agricultural crops, ultimately facilitating breeding programs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Xiao","given":"Yingjie"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiaohong"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Shizhong"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Qingchun"},{"family":"Qiao","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Raihan","given":"Mohammad Sharif"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Haijun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xuehai"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaqing"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Min"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Minliang"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Lijun"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Nannan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Gengshen"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Ye"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Gen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Weidong"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Debo"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jianbing"}],"container-title":"New Phytologist","container-title-short":"New Phytol","DOI":"10.1111/nph.13814","ISSN":"1469-8137","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"1095-1106","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Genome-wide dissection of the maize ear genetic architecture using multiple populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.13814","volume":"210"},

Maize is an ideal crop for GWAS and significant progress has been made in the last decade. This review summarizes current GWAS efforts in maize functional genomics research and discusses future prospects in the omics era. The general goal of GWAS is to link genotypic variations to corresponding differences in phenotype using the most appropriate statistical model in a given population. The current review also presents perspectives for optimizing GWAS design and analysis. GWAS analysis of data from RNA, protein, and metabolite-based omics studies is discussed, along with new models and new population designs that will identify causes of phenotypic variation that have been hidden to date.

It has long been known that differentiated somatic plant cells may reacquire pluripotency, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In many plant species, a single isolated mesophyll protoplast may regenerate into an entire plant, which is widely used in gene transformation. Here, we identified two transcription factors whose ectopic activation promotes protoplast regeneration. Furthermore, we found that their expression was induced by protoplast isolation but at a very low frequency. Using live imaging and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that isolating protoplasts induces enhanced expression variation at the genome level. Isolating protoplasts also leads to genome-wide increases in chromatin accessibility, which promotes stochastic activation of gene expression and enhances protoplast regeneration. We propose that transcriptome chaos with increased expression variability among cells creates a cellular-level evolutionary driver selecting for regenerating cells.\nIsolating protoplasts allows stochastic gene expression to enable regeneration of differentiated cells at a low frequency.\nIsolating protoplasts allows stochastic gene expression to enable regeneration of differentiated cells at a low frequency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Mengxue"},{"family":"Du","given":"Qingwei"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Caihuan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Jiao","given":"Yuling"}],"container-title":"Science Advances","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.abg8466","ISSN":"2375-2548","issue":"33","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"eabg8466","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Article","source":"advances.sciencemag.org","title":"Stochastic gene expression drives mesophyll protoplast regeneration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/33/eabg8466","volume":"7"},

However, these eQTL studies may suffer from low or moderate statistical power and overly conservative false-discovery rate. In practice, most algorithms for eQTL identification do not model the joint effects of multiple genetic variants with weak or moderate influence. Here we present a novel machine-learning algorithm, lasso least-squares kernel machine (LSKM-LASSO) that model the association between multiple genetic variants and phenotypic traits simultaneously with the existence of nongenetic and genetic confounding. With a more general and flexible framework for the estimation of genetic confounding, LSKM-LASSO is able to provide a more accurate evaluation of the joint effects of multiple genetic variants. Our simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of eQTL identification and phenotype prediction. We then apply our method to genotype and gene expression data of 11 tissues obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Our algorithm was able to identify more genes with eQTL than other algorithms. By incorporating a regularization term and combining it with least-squares kernel machine, LSKM-LASSO provides a powerful tool for eQTL mapping and phenotype prediction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Yan","given":"Kang K."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Hongyu"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Joseph T."},{"family":"Pang","given":"Herbert"}],"container-title":"Genetic Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1002/gepi.22341","ISSN":"1098-2272","issue":"n/a","language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/gepi.22341","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"An enhanced machine learning tool for cis-eQTL mapping with regularization and confounder adjustments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/gepi.22341","volume":"n/a"},

Comparisons among TM-1 and ZM24 assemblies and the genomes of the diploid ancestors reveal a large amount of genetic variations. Among them, the top three longest structural variations are located on chromosome A08 of the tetraploid upland cotton, which account for ~30% total length of this chromosome. Haplotype analyses of the mapping population derived from these two cultivars and the germplasm panel show suppressed recombination rates in this region.

Here, we use large-scale genome-wide association study summary data to investigate the shared genetic architecture between MS and IBD overall and UC and CD independently. We find a significantly greater genetic correlation between MS and UC than between MS and CD, and identify three SNPs shared between MS and IBD (rs13428812), UC (rs116555563) and CD (rs13428812, rs9977672) in cross-trait meta-analyses. We find suggestive evidence for a causal effect of MS on UC and IBD using Mendelian randomization, but no or weak and inconsistent evidence for a causal effect of IBD or UC on MS. We observe largely consistent patterns of tissue-specific heritability enrichment for MS and IBDs in lung, spleen, whole blood and small intestine, and identify cell-type-specific enrichment for MS and IBDs in CD4+ T cells in lung and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in lung and spleen.

So far, free-space demonstrations have been limited to line-of-sight links across cities or between mountaintops. Scattering and coherence decay have limited the link separations to around 100 km. Yin et al. used the Micius satellite, which was launched last year and is equipped with a specialized quantum optical payload. They successfully demonstrated the satellite-based entanglement distribution to receiver stations separated by more than 1200 km. The results illustrate the possibility of a future global quantum communication network.\nScience, this issue p. 1140\nLong-distance entanglement distribution is essential for both foundational tests of quantum physics and scalable quantum networks. Owing to channel loss, however, the previously achieved distance was limited to ~100 kilometers. Here we demonstrate satellite-based distribution of entangled photon pairs to two locations separated by 1203 kilometers on Earth, through two satellite-to-ground downlinks with a summed length varying from 1600 to 2400 kilometers. We observed a survival of two-photon entanglement and a violation of Bell inequality by 2.37 ± 0.09 under strict Einstein locality conditions. The obtained effective link efficiency is orders of magnitude higher than that of the direct bidirectional transmission of the two photons through telecommunication fibers.\nEntangled photons are distributed over vast distances using a satellite-to-ground link.\nEntangled photons are distributed over vast distances using a satellite-to-ground link.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Yin","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yu-Huai"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Sheng-Kai"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Ji-Gang"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Wen-Qi"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wei-Yue"},{"family":"Li","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Li","given":"Guang-Bing"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Qi-Ming"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Yun-Hong"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shuang-Lin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Feng-Zhi"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Ya-Yun"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Zi-Qing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Jian-Jun"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Ge"},{"family":"He","given":"Dong"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yi-Lin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiao-Xiang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Na"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Zhen-Cai"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Nai-Le"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yu-Ao"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Chao-Yang"},{"family":"Shu","given":"Rong"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Cheng-Zhi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jian-Yu"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Jian-Wei"}],"container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aan3211","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6343","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,16]]},"language":"en","page":"1140-1144","PMID":"28619937","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Articles","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Satellite-based entanglement distribution over 1200 kilometers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6343/1140","volume":"356"},

  {"id":"yoo2014","abstract":"The single-celled cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fiber provides an excellent model to investigate how human selection affects phenotypic evolution. To gain insight into the evolutionary genomics of cotton domestication, we conducted comparative transcriptome profiling of developing cotton fibers using RNA-Seq. Analysis of single-celled fiber transcriptomes from four wild and five domesticated accessions from two developmental time points revealed that at least one-third and likely one-half of the genes in the genome are expressed at any one stage during cotton fiber development. Among these, ∼5,000 genes are differentially expressed during primary and secondary cell wall synthesis between wild and domesticated cottons, with a biased distribution among chromosomes. Transcriptome data implicate a number of biological processes affected by human selection, and suggest that the domestication process has prolonged the duration of fiber elongation in modern cultivated forms. Functional analysis suggested that wild cottons allocate greater resources to stress response pathways, while domestication led to reprogrammed resource allocation toward increased fiber growth, possibly through modulating stress-response networks. This first global transcriptomic analysis using multiple accessions of wild and domesticated cottons is an important step toward a more comprehensive systems perspective on cotton fiber evolution. The understanding that human selection over the past 5,000+ years has dramatically re-wired the cotton fiber transcriptome sets the stage for a deeper understanding of the genetic architecture underlying cotton fiber synthesis and phenotypic evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Yoo","given":"Mi-Jeong"},{"family":"Wendel","given":"Jonathan F."}],"container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1004073","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"e1004073","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Comparative Evolutionary and Developmental Dynamics of the Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) Fiber Transcriptome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004073","volume":"10"},

Here, we demonstrate that contamination from this \"soup\" of cell free RNAs is ubiquitous, experiment specific in its composition and magnitude, and can lead to erroneous biological conclusions. We present a method, SoupX, for quantifying the extent of the contamination and estimating \"background corrected\", cell expression profiles that can be integrated with existing downstream analysis tools.

  {"id":"yu2019","abstract":"Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fibres consist of single cells that grow in a highly polarized manner, assumed to be controlled by the cytoskeleton1–3. However, how the cytoskeletal organization and dynamics underpin fibre development remains unexplored. Moreover, it is unclear whether cotton fibres expand via tip growth or diffuse growth2–4. We generated stable transgenic cotton plants expressing fluorescent markers of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Live-cell imaging revealed that elongating cotton fibres assemble a cortical filamentous actin network that extends along the cell axis to finally form actin strands with closed loops in the tapered fibre tip. Analyses of F-actin network properties indicate that cotton fibres have a unique actin organization that blends features of both diffuse and tip growth modes. Interestingly, typical actin organization and endosomal vesicle aggregation found in tip-growing cell apices were not observed in fibre tips. Instead, endomembrane compartments were evenly distributed along the elongating fibre cells and moved bi-directionally along the fibre shank to the fibre tip. Moreover, plus-end tracked microtubules transversely encircled elongating fibre shanks, reminiscent of diffusely growing cells. Collectively, our findings indicate that cotton fibres elongate via a unique tip-biased diffuse growth mode.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Yanjun"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shenjie"},{"family":"Nowak","given":"Jacqueline"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Guangda"},{"family":"Han","given":"Libo"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Zhidi"},{"family":"Mendrinna","given":"Amelie"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yinping"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Huan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaxia"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Li"},{"family":"Nikoloski","given":"Zoran"},{"family":"Persson","given":"Staffan"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Zhaosheng"}],"container-title":"Nature Plants","DOI":"10.1038/s41477-019-0418-8","ISSN":"2055-0278","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5]]},"language":"en","number":"5","page":"498-504","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Live-cell imaging of the cytoskeleton in elongating cotton fibres","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-019-0418-8","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"yu2021","abstract":"Cultivated rice varieties are all diploid, and polyploidization of rice has long been desired because of its advantages in genome buffering, vigorousness, and environmental robustness. However, a workable route remains elusive. Here, we describe a practical strategy, namely de novo domestication of wild allotetraploid rice. By screening allotetraploid wild rice inventory, we identiﬁed one genotype of Oryza alta (CCDD), polyploid rice 1 (PPR1), and established two important resources for its de novo domestication: (1) an efﬁcient tissue culture, transformation, and genome editing system and (2) a high-quality genome assembly discriminated into two subgenomes of 12 chromosomes apiece. With these resources, we show that six agronomically important traits could be rapidly improved by editing O. alta homologs of the genes controlling these traits in diploid rice. Our results demonstrate the possibility that de novo domesticated allotetraploid rice can be developed into a new staple cereal to strengthen world food security.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Meng","given":"Xiangbing"},{"family":"Du","given":"Huilong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jingkun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Guifu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Mingjiang"},{"family":"Jing","given":"Yanhui"},{"family":"Kou","given":"Liquan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiuxiu"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiangdong"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Zhilan"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yuntao"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Zhukuan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Mingsheng"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Zhixi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yonghong"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Chengcai"},{"family":"Zuo","given":"Jianru"},{"family":"Wan","given":"Jianmin"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Han","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Zuccolo","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Wing","given":"Rod A."},{"family":"Gao","given":"Caixia"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Chengzhi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiayang"}],"container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2021.01.013","ISSN":"00928674","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","page":"S0092867421000131","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A route to de novo domestication of wild allotetraploid rice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867421000131"},

  {"id":"zeng1994","abstract":"Adequate separation of effects of possible multiple linked quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on mapping QTLs is the key to increasing the precision of QTL mapping. A new method of QTL mapping is proposed and analyzed in this paper by combining interval mapping with multiple regression. The basis of the proposed method is an interval test in which the test statistic on a marker interval is made to be unaffected by QTLs located outside a defined interval. This is achieved by fitting other genetic markers in the statistical model as a control when performing interval mapping. Compared with the current QTL mapping method (i.e., the interval mapping method which uses a pair or two pairs of markers for mapping QTLs), this method has several advantages. (1) By confining the test to one region at a time, it reduces a multiple dimensional search problem (for multiple QTLs) to a one dimensional search problem. (2) By conditioning linked markers in the test, the sensitivity of the test statistic to the position of individual QTLs is increased, and the precision of QTL mapping can be improved. (3) By selectively and simultaneously using other markers in the analysis, the efficiency of QTL mapping can be also improved. The behavior of the test statistic under the null hypothesis and appropriate critical value of the test statistic for an overall test in a genome are discussed and analyzed. A simulation study of QTL mapping is also presented which illustrates the utility, properties, advantages and disadvantages of the method.","author":[{"family":"Zeng","given":"Z.

Sequencing of a haploid S. spontaneum, AP85-441, facilitated the assembly of 32 pseudo-chromosomes comprising 8 homologous groups of 4 members each, bearing 35,525 genes with alleles defined. The reduction of basic chromosome number from 10 to 8 in S. spontaneum was caused by fissions of 2 ancestral chromosomes followed by translocations to 4 chromosomes. Surprisingly, 80% of nucleotide binding site-encoding genes associated with disease resistance are located in 4 rearranged chromosomes and 51% of those in rearranged regions. Resequencing of 64 S. spontaneum genomes identified balancing selection in rearranged regions, maintaining their diversity. Introgressed S. spontaneum chromosomes in modern sugarcanes are randomly distributed in AP85-441 genome, indicating random recombination among homologs in different S. spontaneum accessions. The allele-defined Saccharum genome offers new knowledge and resources to accelerate sugarcane improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jisen"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xingtan"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Haibao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Hua","given":"Xiuting"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Xiaokai"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Fan"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Tyler"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xinguang"},{"family":"Bowers","given":"John"},{"family":"Wai","given":"Ching Man"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Chunfang"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Xiuming"},{"family":"Yue","given":"Jingjing"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"David R."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Lixian"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Huimin"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Dong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yongjun"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Weichang"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jishan"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Youjin"},{"family":"Pandey","given":"Neha"},{"family":"Mancini","given":"Melina"},{"family":"Zerpa","given":"Dessireé"},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Julie K."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Liming"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Xin","given":"Yinghui"},{"family":"Ge","given":"Liangfa"},{"family":"Arro","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Han","given":"Jennifer O."},{"family":"Chakrabarty","given":"Setu"},{"family":"Pushko","given":"Marija"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wenping"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yanhong"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Panpan"},{"family":"Lv","given":"Mingju"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Faming"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Guangyong"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Jingsheng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhenhui"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Fang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xuequn"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Zhenyang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xunxiao"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Zhicong"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Hai"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Hansong"},{"family":"Kuang","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Weimin"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Pingping"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Guofeng"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Jiaxian"},{"family":"Hou","given":"Jinxiang"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Jingxian"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Jingjing"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Peijian"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Qiaochu"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yaying"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaodan"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Rongrong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yongmei"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Haifeng"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhiliang"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Jingping"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Hongkun"},{"family":"Song","given":"Jinjin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Mengjuan"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Guangrui"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Gang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zheng"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Teng"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Dhungana","given":"Singha R."},{"family":"Huss","given":"Sarah E."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiping"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Anupma"},{"family":"Trujillo","given":"Jhon H."},{"family":"Martinez","given":"Maria C."},{"family":"Hudson","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Riascos","given":"John J."},{"family":"Schuler","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Li-Qing"},{"family":"Braun","given":"David M."},{"family":"Li","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Qingyi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jianping"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Schatz","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Heckerman","given":"David"},{"family":"Van Sluys","given":"Marie-Anne"},{"family":"Souza","given":"Glaucia Mendes"},{"family":"Moore","given":"Paul H."},{"family":"Sankoff","given":"David"},{"family":"VanBuren","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Paterson","given":"Andrew H."},{"family":"Nagai","given":"Chifumi"},{"family":"Ming","given":"Ray"}],"container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-018-0237-2","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,11]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Genomics;Plant genetics\nSubject_term_id: genomics;plant-genetics","number":"11","page":"1565-1573","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Allele-defined genome of the autopolyploid sugarcane Saccharum spontaneum L.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0237-2","volume":"50"},

Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the genetic basis of VW resistance using bi-parental or association mapping populations. In this study, a multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) population of 550 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) together with their 11 Upland cotton parents with a total of 473,516 polymorphic SNP markers was used to identify chromosomal regions for VW resistance based on foliar disease severity ratings (DSR) in two replicated greenhouse tests. Among the 11 parents, Acala Ultima, Coker 315, and Deltapine Acala 90 in the two tests and FiberMax 966 in one test and on average were significantly more resistant than the susceptible check parent- Phytogen PSC 355, while Paymaster HS 26, SureGrow 747, Stoneville 474, Stoneville 825, and Tamcot Pyramid performed similarly to PSC 355. Although a significant genotype × test interaction was detected for DSR, 37 MAGIC lines were consistently resistant to VW. Of 13 and 12 VW resistance QTL declared in Test 1 and 2, respectively, through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), three QTL on chromosome A01, D02 and D08 were in common and three QTL clusters were detected on chromosome A01, A13, and D01 between the two tests. The narrow chromosomal regions for the three common resistance QTL allowed identification of possible candidate genes for VW resistance. This greenhouse study identified VW resistant parents and RILs and common resistance QTL for VW resistance, providing useful information for developing VW resistant cultivars and further genomic studies towards the identification of VW resistance genes in cotton.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jinfa"},{"family":"Abdelraheem","given":"Abdelraheem"},{"family":"Thyssen","given":"Gregory N."},{"family":"Fang","given":"David D."},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Johnie N."},{"family":"McCarty","given":"Jack C."},{"family":"Wedegaertner","given":"Tom"}],"container-title":"Euphytica","container-title-short":"Euphytica","DOI":"10.1007/s10681-019-2547-6","ISSN":"1573-5060","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,19]]},"language":"en","page":"9","source":"Springer Link","title":"Evaluation and genome-wide association study of Verticillium wilt resistance in a MAGIC population derived from intermating of eleven Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) parents","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10681-019-2547-6","volume":"216"},

  {"id":"zhang2019b","abstract":"Construction of chromosome-level assembly is a vital step in achieving the goal of a ‘Platinum’ genome, but it remains a major challenge to assemble and anchor sequences to chromosomes in autopolyploid or highly heterozygous genomes. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology serves as a robust tool to dramatically advance chromosome scaffolding; however, existing approaches are mostly designed for diploid genomes and often with the aim of reconstructing a haploid representation, thereby having limited power to reconstruct chromosomes for autopolyploid genomes. We developed a novel algorithm (ALLHiC) that is capable of building allele-aware, chromosomal-scale assembly for autopolyploid genomes using Hi-C paired-end reads with innovative ‘prune’ and ‘optimize’ steps. Application on simulated data showed that ALLHiC can phase allelic contigs and substantially improve ordering and orientation when compared to other mainstream Hi-C assemblers. We applied ALLHiC on an autotetraploid and an autooctoploid sugar-cane genome and successfully constructed the phased chromosomal-level assemblies, revealing allelic variations present in these two genomes. The ALLHiC pipeline enables de novo chromosome-level assembly of autopolyploid genomes, separating each allele. Haplotype chromosome-level assembly of allopolyploid and heterozygous diploid genomes can be achieved using ALLHiC, overcoming obstacles in assembling complex genomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xingtan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shengcheng"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Ming","given":"Ray"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Haibao"}],"container-title":"Nature Plants","container-title-short":"Nat.

However, our understanding of the transcriptional variability in sweet potato remains limited. Here, we analyzed two publicly available datasets to explore the landscape of transcriptomic variations and its genetic basis in the storage roots of sweet potato. The comprehensive analysis identified a total of 724,438 high-confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 26,026 expressed genes. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis revealed 4408 eQTLs regulating the expression of 3646 genes, including 2261 local eQTLs and 2147 distant eQTLs. Two distant eQTL hotspots were found with target genes significantly enriched in specific functional classifications. By combining the information from regulatory network analyses, eQTLs and association mapping, we found that IbMYB1-2 acts as a master regulator and is the major gene responsible for the activation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the storage roots of sweet potato.

  {"id":"zhang2020a","abstract":"Flowering plants, or angiosperms, consist of more than 300,000 species, far more than any other land plant lineages. The accumulated evidence indicates that multiple ancient polyploidy events occurred around 100 to 120 million years ago during the Cretaceous and drove the early diversification of four major clades of angiosperms: gamma whole-genome triplication in the common ancestor of core eudicots, tau whole-genome duplication during the early diversification of monocots, lambda whole-genome duplication during the early diversification of magnoliids, and pi whole-genome duplication in the Nymphaeales lineage. These four polyploidy events have played essential roles in the adaptive evolution and diversification of major clades of flowering plants. Here, we specifically review the current understanding of this wave of ancient whole-genome duplications and their evolutionary significance. Notably, although these ancient whole-genome duplications occurred independently, they have contributed to the expansion of many stress-related genes (e.g., heat shock transcription factors and Arabidopsis response regulators)，and these genes could have been selected for by global environmental changes in the Cretaceous. Therefore, this ancient wave of paleopolyploidy events could have significantly contributed to the adaptation of angiosperms to environmental changes, and potentially promoted the wide diversification of flowering plants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Liangsheng"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shengdan"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Xiaojun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiuyun"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yunpeng"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Yiping"},{"family":"Trigiano","given":"Robert N."},{"family":"Jiao","given":"Yuannian"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Fei"}],"container-title":"Plant, Cell & Environment","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.13898","ISSN":"1365-3040","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/pce.13898","page":"2847-2856","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The ancient wave of polyploidization events in flowering plants and their facilitated adaptation to environmental stress","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pce.13898","volume":"43"},

  {"id":"zhang2021d","abstract":"Cloning quantitative trait locus (QTL) is time consuming and laborious, which hinders the understanding of natural variation and genetic diversity. Here, we introduce RapMap, a method for rapid multi-QTL mapping by employing F2 gradient populations (F2GPs) constructed by minor-phenotypic-difference accessions. The co-segregation standard of the single-locus genetic models ensures simultaneous integration of a three-in-one framework in RapMap i.e. detecting a real QTL, confirming its effect, and obtaining its near-isogenic line-like line (NIL-LL). We demonstrate the feasibility of RapMap by cloning eight rice grain-size genes using 15 F2GPs in three years. These genes explain a total of 75% of grain shape variation.

  {"id":"zhu2018","abstract":"Humans heavily rely on dozens of domesticated plant species that have been further improved through intensive breeding. To evaluate how breeding changed the tomato fruit metabolome, we have generated and analyzed a dataset encompassing genomes, transcriptomes, and metabolomes from hundreds of tomato genotypes. The combined results illustrate how breeding globally altered fruit metabolite content. Selection for alleles of genes associated with larger fruits altered metabolite proﬁles as a consequence of linkage with nearby genes. Selection of ﬁve major loci reduced the accumulation of anti-nutritional steroidal glycoalkaloids in ripened fruits, rendering the fruit more edible. Breeding for pink tomatoes modiﬁed the content of over 100 metabolites. The introgression of resistance genes from wild relatives in cultivars also resulted in major and unexpected metabolic changes. The study reveals a multi-omics view of the metabolic breeding history of tomato, as well as provides insights into metabolome-assisted breeding and plant biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Guangtao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shouchuang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Zejun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shuaibin"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Qinggang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chunzhi"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Mao"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Chenkun"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Xue"},{"family":"Han","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaoxuan"},{"family":"Knaap","given":"Esther","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhonghua"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Xia"},{"family":"Klee","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Fernie","given":"Alisdair R."},{"family":"Luo","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Sanwen"}],"container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2017.12.019","event-place":"Cambridge","ISSN":"00928674","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1]]},"language":"en","page":"249-261.e12","publisher":"Cell Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rewiring of the Fruit Metabolome in Tomato Breeding","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S009286741731499X","volume":"172"},

It models variants in a gene as a mixture of risk and non-risk variants, with a prior probability of being a risk variant determined by functional annotations of the variant such as\n    conservation score and impact on protein structure. Since in general external annotations alone have limited accuracy in predicting functional effects, a simple filter based on such annotations (as commonly performed in \n    many RV association analysis) may result in both false positive and negatives. Instead, by incorporating such information as prior and using a hierarchical model to pool information across genes, `mirage` is able to better\n    characterize the inclusion probability of rare variants for different functional categories, thus improving the power to detect an association.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,26]]},"language":"en","title":"An R package for mixture model based rare variant analysis on genes.","type":"webpage","URL":"https://xinhe-lab.github.io/mirage/"},

The parameter estimates will only differ if the variables are correlated and the sets of variables that are included in the models differ. \n\nRegarding the tests of the coefficients, it depends on which function you use to get your output. You used summary(). What is reported then are the 𝑡-tests associated with the parameter estimates. Those are not computed by partitioning sums of squares. However, they are equivalent to 𝐹-tests using type III SS. The order variables are listed in doesn't matter for 𝑡-tests or 𝐹-tests that are based on type III SS. You can also use anova() to get significance tests of your parameter estimates. That is where R uses type I SS.
