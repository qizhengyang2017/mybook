> "a flexible Bayesian statistical approach" ([McCoy et al 2017:917](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=2))

> "While these studies suggest phenotypes that may be impacted by past hybridization, the functional mechanisms by which these associations arise remain poorly characterized. Regulatory variation influencing gene expression is a key source of phenotypic variation within and between species (King and Wilson, 1975)." ([McCoy et al 2017:917](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=2))

> "Applying our statistical framework to the GTEx data identified 1,236 introgressed SNPs (24.5%) in 767 genes that showed significant ASE at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 10%" ([McCoy et al 2017:918](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=3))

> "We observed that the Neanderthal allele was upregulated for 49.8% and downregulated for 50.2% of SNPs showing significant ASE, indicating no overall directional bias (binomial test: 95% CI [0.469, 0.526], p = 0.887)." ([McCoy et al 2017:918](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=3))

> "Several additional introgressed variants exhibiting significant ASE were previously linked to human disease traits in published genome-wide association studies (GWAS), suggesting potential cis-regulatory mechanisms underlying these associations." ([McCoy et al 2017:919](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=4))

> "Disease-associated Neanderthal regulatory variants furthermore reveal how hybridization contributed to the genomic complexity of modern humans." ([McCoy et al 2017:919](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=4))

> "Specifically, the Neanderthal allele introduces a splice acceptor site in exon" ([McCoy et al 2017:919](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=4))

> "30 (Figure 3), resulting in alternative splicing and truncation of the protease and lacunin (PLAC) domain encompassing rs950169." ([McCoy et al 2017:920](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=5))

> "we hypothesized that Neanderthal-introgressed variants may be enriched for ASE compared to segregating mutations that arose in modern humans." ([McCoy et al 2017:920](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=5))

> "The paucity of SNPs exhibiting large effects is consistent with previous studies showing that cis-regulatory effects are generally consistent across tissues and experimental conditions" ([McCoy et al 2017:922](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=7))

> "When Neanderthal cis-regulatory elements introgressed into the modern human trans-regulatory background, genes may have failed to be expressed at the same level as in their native regulatory environments (Figure 6). Such epistasis between cisand trans-acting factors is well documented in nature, can arise rapidly as a consequence of selection on gene regulation, and is known to contribute to hybrid incompatibilities" ([McCoy et al 2017:924](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=9))

> "While misregulation due to epistasis may also lead to increased expression, decreased expression may be more common, as recently concluded by Guerrero et al. (2016) who found significant downregulation of introgressed genes in nightshade plants." ([McCoy et al 2017:924](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=9))

> "Neanderthals went extinct approximately 40,000 years ago, yet much of their DNA lives on in the genomes of modern humans." ([McCoy et al 2017:924](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LKUCRG9X?page=9))

> "Need, A.C., Ge, D., Weale, M.E., Maia, J., Feng, S., Heinzen, E.L., Shianna, K.V., Yoon, W., Kasperaviciute, D., Gennarelli, M., et al. (2009).

> "For each frequency bin, we then simulated 100,000 draws from each of these distributions to form the distribution of pN - pH, taking empirical 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of this distribution to form credible intervals (Figure 4B). We note that while the FDR (10% overall) may vary across frequency bins, it is not expected to differ between introgressed and non-introgressed SNPs within frequency bins."
