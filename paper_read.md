同源多倍体基因组可以叫Allele-defined genome。https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-018-0237-2

高度杂合二倍体叫Haplotype-resolved genome。https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-021-00895-y
phased genome与halotype-resolved genome有什么不同


Raw sequencing reads from PacBio, Illumina, 10× Genomics, Hi-C, RNA-seq and Iso-seq were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database under the accession number PRJNA665594 and/or in the GSA database (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gsa/) under the accession number PRJCA003090. The assembly and annotation were archived in the National Center for Biotechnology Information under the accession number JAFLEL000000000 and in the GWH (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gwh/) under accession numbers GWHASIV00000000 for the monoploid and GWHASIX00000000 for the haplotype-resolved genome. VCF files that contain all clean SNPs were uploaded to the Mendeley database (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/7hb33vd7sf/1). In addition, three datasets that were used to assess switch errors in the haplotype-resolved TGY genome assembly were deposited to the Mendeley database (https://doi.org/10.17632/xpccyg5w2x.1).

杂合的怎么组装？
