至少三个纤维素合酶 (CesA) 基因 

at least three cellulose synthase (CesA) genes 

A number of inter- specific reciprocal introgression events has been found between G. hirsutum and G. barbadense, and the introgression pattern is significantly biased toward the gene flow from G. hirsutum into G. bar- badense (16)
