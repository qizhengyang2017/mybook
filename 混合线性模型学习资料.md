## GRM
指genetic relatedness matrix，亲缘关系矩阵，可能GCTA做关联的时候会使用

>In 2009, [GCTA](https://cnsgenomics.com/software/gcta/) didn't exist. Today, there is an important and growing ecosystem of tools supporting the use of genetic relationship matrices in mixed model association analysis and other calculations; our contributions are a fast, multithreaded, memory-efficient [--make-grm-gz/--make-grm-bin](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/distance#make_grm) implementation which runs on macOS and Windows as well as Linux, and a closer-to-optimal [--rel-cutoff](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/distance#rel_cutoff) pruner.
>There are other additions here and there, such as [cluster-based filters](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/filter#cluster) which might make a few population geneticists' lives easier, and a [coordinate-descent LASSO](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/assoc#lasso). New functions are not a top priority for now (reaching 95%+ backward compatibility, and supporting dosage/phased/triallelic data, are more important...), but we're willing to take time off from just working on the program core if you ask nicely.


## GCTA
杨剑的网站写的很清晰
https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/#Overview
使用GCTA （GREML）来估计SNP-遗传力 SNP Heritability。[参考](https://gwaslab.com/2021/04/11/%e4%bd%bf%e7%94%a8gcta-%ef%bc%88greml%ef%bc%89%e6%9d%a5%e4%bc%b0%e8%ae%a1snp-%e9%81%97%e4%bc%a0%e5%8a%9b-snp-heritability/)
