  {"id":"2020","abstract":"现在使用 MathJaX 直接在浏览器里显示数学公式已经非常方便了，基本上只要在 HTML header 里插入两句引用一下 MathJaX 的 CDN，然后在页面里的 LaTeX 公式就会被自动转化为数学公式显示。运作方式是 MathJaX 作为 Javascript 在客户端浏览器里运行，寻找 HTML 文档里的 LaTeX 表达式，然后将其转化为公式（通过 HTML 或者 SVG 排版的方式）显示出来。不过客户端渲染有一些小问题就是每次用户打开都要重新渲染，取决于用户的网速、系统运行 JS 的速度等等，可能渲染速度会不太一样，而且后期渲染会导致 HTML 文档布局变化等等。所以有时候考虑在 server 端预渲染是一个不错的选择。 在 MathJaX 出现之前一般 server 端的渲染是基于真实的 LaTeX 的，就是直接运行 LaTeX 编译出 dvi 文件，然后用 dvipng 之类的工具转化为图片格式，插入到 HTML 文档中。这种方式的好处是和 LaTeX 完全兼容，坏处一个是需要运行 shell 去调用 LaTeX，如果是用户输入的文本的话可能有一定安全隐患，而且对 server 负担可能也有点大，当然最重要的还是 png 这类的图片格式显示的公式特别是在 inline 的时候不能很好地和周围的文本对齐，经常会很难看。 另一个就是把 MathJaX 在 server 端预先渲染成 SVG 格式。实际上我这个博客里之前的公式一直是这样显示的，这样可以整个页面静态加载，即使客户端禁用了 Javascript 也能显示，再复杂一些也许可以做到在支持 SVG 的 RSS Reader 里也能直接显示公式。我使用的是一个叫做 svgtex 的工具。它的运行方式是通过 PhantomJS 在 server 端跑起 MathJaX 来，然后在一个端口监听，你可以通过发送 HTTP 请求到该端口，输入 LaTeX 的公式，它就会调用 MathJaX 进行渲染，然后把渲染的结果（SVG 格式）发送回来。由于我的博客是编译成静态页面的，所以我直接做了一个简单的后期处理，拿到 SVG 之后替换掉 LaTeX 公式文本内嵌到 HTML 中即可（因为 SVG 其实是文本格式），我用类似于下面这一段代码来做后期处理： require 'uri'require 'net/http'def tex2svg_impl(math, display=false) # undo some preprocessing done by pandoc require 'cgi' math = CGI.unescapeHTML(math) uri = URI.parse('http://localhost:16000') http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port) request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(uri.request_uri) if display request.body = '\\displaystyle{' + math + '}' else request.body = math end http.request(request).bodyenddesc \"convert MathJaX formula to embeded SVG\"task :tex2svg do require 'find' # currently do not support rss.xml, because # 1. pandoc do HTML escape, which is escaped again in XML, making # it difficult to unescape # 2. the SVG image is displayed as crazily full page-width images # in Firefox RSS view Find.find('compiled-production') do |path| if path.match(/html\\Z/) puts path content = File.read(path) content.gsub! /<span class=\"math[^\"]*\">(.*?)<\\/span>/m do |match| # strip \\( \\) or \\[ \\] math = $1[2..-3] if $1[1] == '(' '<span style=\"font-size:100%; display:inline-block;\">' + tex2svg_impl(math) + '</span>' else '<span class=\"svg-math-block\">' + tex2svg_impl(math, true) + '</span>' end end File.open(path, 'w') do |f| f.write(content) end end endend 不过我的 Blog 代码也是很多年前写的了，最近换新电脑的时候做系统迁移才发现原来 PhantomJS 都已经停止开发了，然后 svgtex 也已经 depreciated 了……不过 svgtex 有一个后继者叫做 mathoid，看了一下现在已经是 Wikimedia 的项目了，看来 Wikipedia 现在已经是用这个在做 server 端渲染了，居然一直都没有注意到。 这个 mathoid 最开始是从 svgtex fork 出来的，使用方法基本差不多，不过不再依赖于 PhantomJS，而是基于 node.js。但是我对 node.js 并不是很熟悉，感觉 setup 又会有多一套系统需要维护，由于我现在写 blog 的频率并不高，生成博客的代码维护则更是几乎没有在跟进，这次在修理 Rack 更新之后出现的问题花了很久，发现我都几乎不太会写 Ruby 代码了，越发意识到这种没有积极维护的系统还是依赖越少，功能越简单越好，而且 server side 渲染对我来说其实并不是一定要有的功能，所以最后干脆又切换回了直接使用 MathJaX 的 CDN 在客户端渲染的方式。 不过换回去之前想把这个解决方案在这里分享一下，有可能以后会有用，而且之前也有人问过我 blog 里的公式是怎么显示的，因为右键并不会弹出 MathJaX 的菜单哈哈。不过这里还值得一提的是一个后来出现的叫做 KaTeX 的 MathJaX 的竞争者，它是直接支持 server 端渲染的，如果你有一个 server 端 javascript 系统（比如 node.js），可以直接这样渲染： var html = katex.renderToString(\"c = \\\\pm\\\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\", { throwOnError: false }); // '<span class=\"katex\">...</span>' 当然 KaTeX 和 MathJaX 相比各有优缺点，KaTeX 的优势是速度比 MathJaX 快很多（虽然 MathJaX 对于普通使用来说已经不慢了），不过相比就是支持的 TeX 命令可能没有后者那么全，虽然这些年来已经改进了很多了，不过似乎有些复杂的公式显示还是和 MathJaX 渲染的结果有一些差距。网上有一些比较详细的比较，比如 这个页面，具体用哪个还是看自己的需求啦。","citation-key":"2020","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,2,9]]},"title":"Server Side Math Rendering","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://freemind.pluskid.org/technology/server-side-math-rendering"},

Here, a best-fitting line is defined as one that minimizes the average squared  distance from the points to the line. These directions constitute an orthonormal basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are linearly uncorrelated. Principal component analysis (PCA) is the process of computing the principal components and using them to perform a change of basis on the data, sometimes using only the first few principal components and ignoring the rest.\nPCA is used in exploratory data analysis and for making predictive models. It is commonly used for dimensionality reduction by projecting each data point onto only the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible. The first principal component can equivalently be defined as a direction that maximizes the variance of the projected data. The \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          i\n          \n            th\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i^{\\text{th}}}\n   principal component can be taken as a direction orthogonal to the first \n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        −\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i-1}\n   principal components that maximizes the variance of the projected data. \nFrom either objective, it can be shown that the principal components are eigenvectors of the data's covariance matrix. Thus, the principal components are often computed by eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix or singular value decomposition of the data matrix. PCA is the simplest of the true eigenvector-based multivariate analyses and is closely related to factor analysis. Factor analysis typically incorporates more domain specific assumptions about the underlying structure and solves eigenvectors of a slightly different matrix. PCA is also related to canonical correlation analysis (CCA). CCA defines coordinate systems that optimally describe the cross-covariance between two datasets while PCA defines a new orthogonal coordinate system that optimally describes variance in a single dataset.

  {"id":"2021","abstract":"Genetic linkage is the tendency of DNA sequences that are close together on a chromosome to be inherited together during the meiosis phase of sexual reproduction. Two genetic markers that are physically near to each other are unlikely to be separated onto different chromatids during chromosomal crossover, and are therefore said to be more linked than markers that are far apart. In other words, the nearer two genes are on a chromosome, the lower the chance of recombination between them, and the more likely they are to be inherited together. Markers on different chromosomes are perfectly unlinked.\nGenetic linkage is the most prominent exception to Gregor Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment. The first experiment to demonstrate linkage was carried out in 1905. At the time, the reason why certain traits tend to be inherited together was unknown. Later work revealed that genes are physical structures related by physical distance.\nThe typical unit of genetic linkage is the centimorgan (cM). A distance of 1 cM between two markers means that the markers are separated to different chromosomes on average once per 100 meiotic product, thus once per 50 meioses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,28]]},"citation-key":"2021","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,6]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 998658952","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Genetic linkage","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genetic_linkage&oldid=998658952"},

  {"id":"2021aa","abstract":"Genetics is a branch of biology concerned with the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms.Though heredity had been observed for millennia, Gregor Mendel, Moravian scientist and Augustinian friar working in the 19th century in Brno, was the first to study genetics scientifically. Mendel studied \"trait inheritance\", patterns in the way traits are handed down from parents to offspring over time. He observed that organisms (pea plants) inherit traits by way of discrete \"units of inheritance\". This term, still used today, is a somewhat ambiguous definition of what is referred to as a gene.\nTrait inheritance and molecular inheritance mechanisms of genes are still primary principles of genetics in the 21st century, but modern genetics has expanded beyond inheritance to studying the function and behavior of genes. Gene structure and function, variation, and distribution are studied within the context of the cell, the organism (e.g. dominance), and within the context of a population. Genetics has given rise to a number of subfields, including molecular genetics, epigenetics and population genetics. Organisms studied within the broad field span the domains of life (archaea, bacteria, and eukarya).\nGenetic processes work in combination with an organism's environment and experiences to influence development and behavior, often referred to as nature versus nurture. The intracellular or extracellular environment of a living cell or organism may switch gene transcription on or off. A classic example is two seeds of genetically identical corn, one placed in a temperate climate and one in an arid climate (lacking sufficient waterfall or rain). While the average height of the two corn stalks may be genetically determined to be equal, the one in the arid climate only grows to half the height of the one in the temperate climate due to lack of water and nutrients in its environment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,6]]},"citation-key":"2021aa","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,11]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1043731707","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Genetics","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genetics&oldid=1043731707"},
  {"id":"2021ac","abstract":"Gossypium () is a genus of flowering plants in the tribe Gossypieae of the mallow family, Malvaceae, from which cotton is harvested. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Old and New Worlds. There are about 50 Gossypium species, making it the largest genus in the tribe Gossypieae, and new species continue to be discovered. The name of the genus is derived from the Arabic word goz, which refers to a soft substance.Cotton is the primary natural fibre used by modern humans, amounting to about 80% of world natural fibre production. Where cotton is cultivated, it is a major oilseed crop and a main protein source for animal feed. Cotton is thus of great importance for agriculture, industry and trade, especially for tropical and subtropical countries in Africa, South America and Asia. Consequently, the genus Gossypium has long attracted the attention of scientists.\nThe origin of the genus Gossypium is dated to around 5–10 million years ago. Gossypium species are distributed in arid to semiarid regions of the tropics and subtropics. Generally shrubs or shrub-like plants, the species of this genus are extraordinarily diverse in morphology and adaptation, ranging from fire-adapted, herbaceous perennials in Australia to trees in Mexico. Most wild cottons are diploid, but a group of five species from America and Pacific islands are tetraploid, apparently due to a single hybridization event around 1.5 to 2 million years ago. The tetraploid species are G. hirsutum, G. tomentosum, G. mustelinum, G. barbadense, and G. darwinii.\nCultivated cottons are perennial shrubs, most often grown as annuals. Plants are 1–2 m high in modern cropping systems, sometimes higher in traditional, multiannual cropping systems, now largely disappearing. The leaves are broad and lobed, with three to five (or rarely seven) lobes. The seeds are contained in a capsule called a \"boll\", each seed surrounded by fibres of two types. These fibres are the more commercially interesting part of the plant and they are separated from the seed by a process called ginning. At the first ginning, the longer fibres, called staples, are removed and these are twisted together to form yarn for making thread and weaving into high quality textiles. At the second ginning, the shorter fibres, called \"linters\", are removed, and these are woven into lower quality textiles (which include the eponymous Lint). Commercial species of cotton plant are G. hirsutum (>90% of world production), G. barbadense (3–4%), G. arboreum and G. herbaceum (together, 2%). Many varieties of cotton have been developed by selective breeding and hybridization of these species.  Experiments are ongoing to cross-breed various desirable traits of wild cotton species into the principal commercial species, such as resistance to insects and diseases, and drought tolerance. Cotton fibres occur naturally in colours of white, brown, green, and some mixing of these.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,13]]},"citation-key":"2021ac","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,3]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1047989184","source":"Wikipedia","title":"<i>Gossypium</i>","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gossypium&oldid=1047989184"},

  {"id":"2021af","abstract":"A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms that includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, separately from the other eukaryotic kingdoms, which by one traditional classification include Plantae, Animalia, Protozoa, and Chromista.\nA characteristic that places fungi in a different kingdom from plants, bacteria, and some protists is chitin in their cell walls. Fungi, like animals, are heterotrophs; they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules, typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment. Fungi do not photosynthesize. Growth is their means of mobility, except for spores (a few of which are flagellated), which may travel through the air or water. Fungi are the principal decomposers in ecological systems. These and other differences place fungi in a single group of related organisms, named the Eumycota (true fungi or Eumycetes), that share a common ancestor (i.e. they form a monophyletic group), an interpretation that is also strongly supported by molecular phylogenetics. This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar myxomycetes (slime molds) and oomycetes (water molds). The discipline of biology devoted to the study of fungi is known as mycology (from the Greek μύκης mykes, mushroom). In the past, mycology was regarded as a branch of botany, although it is now known fungi are genetically more closely related to animals than to plants.\nAbundant worldwide, most fungi are inconspicuous because of the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, plant diseases and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.\nThe fungus kingdom encompasses an enormous diversity of taxa with varied ecologies, life cycle strategies, and morphologies ranging from unicellular aquatic chytrids to large mushrooms. However, little is known of the true biodiversity of Kingdom Fungi, which has been estimated at 2.2 million to 3.8 million species. Of these, only about 148,000 have been described, with over 8,000 species known to be detrimental to plants and at least 300 that can be pathogenic to humans. Ever since the pioneering 18th and 19th century taxonomical works of Carl Linnaeus, Christiaan Hendrik Persoon, and Elias Magnus Fries, fungi have been classified according to their morphology (e.g., characteristics such as spore color or microscopic features) or physiology. Advances in molecular genetics have opened the way for DNA analysis to be incorporated into taxonomy, which has sometimes challenged the historical groupings based on morphology and other traits. Phylogenetic studies published in the first decade of the 21st century have helped reshape the classification within Kingdom Fungi, which is divided into one subkingdom, seven phyla, and ten subphyla.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,23]]},"citation-key":"2021af","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,28]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1057656541","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Fungus","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fungus&oldid=1057656541"},

  {"id":"2021au","abstract":"In mathematics, an equation is a statement that asserts the equality of two expressions, which are connected by the equals sign \"=\". The word equation and its cognates in other languages may have subtly different meanings; for example, in French an équation is defined as containing one or more variables, while in English,  any equality is an equation.Solving an equation containing variables consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. The variables for which the equation has to be solved are also called unknowns, and the values of the unknowns that satisfy the equality are called solutions of the equation. There are two kinds of equations: identities and conditional equations. An identity is true for all values of the variables. A conditional equation is only true for particular values of the variables.An equation is written as two expressions, connected by an equals sign (\"=\"). The expressions on the two sides of the equals sign are called the \"left-hand side\" and \"right-hand side\" of the equation. Very often the right-hand side of an equation is assumed to be zero. Assuming this does not reduce the generality, as this can be realized by subtracting the right-hand side from both sides.\nThe most common type of equation is a polynomial equation (commonly called also an algebraic equation) in which the two sides are polynomials.\nThe sides of a polynomial equation contain one or more terms. For example, the equation \n\n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        x\n        +\n        C\n        −\n        y\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y=0}\n  has left-hand side \n  \n    \n      \n        A\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        B\n        x\n        +\n        C\n        −\n        y\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Ax^{2}+Bx+C-y}\n  , which has four terms, and right-hand side \n  \n    \n      \n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 0}\n  , consisting of just one term. The names of the variables suggest that x and y are unknowns, and that  A, B, and C are parameters, but this is normally fixed by the context (in some contexts, y may be a parameter, or A, B, and C may be ordinary variables).\nAn equation is analogous to a scale into which weights are placed. When equal weights of something (e.g., grain) are placed into the two pans, the two weights cause the scale to be in balance and are said to be equal. If a quantity of grain is removed from one pan of the balance, an equal amount of grain must be removed from the other pan to keep the scale in balance. More generally, an  equation remains in balance if the same operation is performed on its both sides.\nIn Cartesian geometry, equations are used to describe geometric figures. As the equations that are considered, such as implicit equations or parametric equations, have infinitely many solutions, the objective is now different: instead of giving the solutions explicitly or counting them, which is impossible, one uses equations for studying properties of figures. This is the starting idea of algebraic geometry, an important area of mathematics.\nAlgebra studies two main families of equations: polynomial equations and, among them, the special case of linear equations. When there is only one variable, polynomial equations have the form P(x) = 0, where P is a polynomial, and linear equations have the form ax + b = 0, where a and b are parameters. To solve equations from either family, one uses algorithmic or geometric techniques that originate from linear algebra or mathematical analysis. Algebra also studies Diophantine equations where the coefficients and solutions are integers. The techniques used are different and come from number theory. These equations are difficult in general; one often searches just to find the existence or absence of a solution, and, if they exist, to count the number of solutions.\nDifferential equations are equations that involve one or more functions and their derivatives. They are solved by finding an expression for the function that does not involve derivatives. Differential equations are used to model processes that involve the rates of change of the variable, and are used in areas such as physics, chemistry, biology, and economics.\nThe \"=\" symbol, which appears in every equation, was invented in 1557 by Robert Recorde, who considered that nothing could be more equal than parallel straight lines with the same length.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,13]]},"citation-key":"2021au","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,16]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1060566145","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Equation","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation&oldid=1060566145"},

  {"id":"2021aw","abstract":"Hemorrhoids (or haemorrhoids), also known as piles, are vascular structures in the anal canal. In their normal state, they are cushions that help with stool control. They become a disease when swollen or inflamed; the unqualified term \"hemorrhoid\" is often used to refer to the disease. The signs and symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on the type present. Internal hemorrhoids often result in painless, bright red rectal bleeding when defecating. External hemorrhoids often result in pain and swelling in the area of the anus. If bleeding occurs it is usually darker. Symptoms frequently get better after a few days. A skin tag may remain after the healing of an external hemorrhoid.While the exact cause of hemorrhoids remains unknown, a number of factors that increase pressure in the abdomen are believed to be involved. This may include constipation, diarrhea, and sitting on the toilet for a long time. Hemorrhoids are also more common during pregnancy. Diagnosis is made by looking at the area. Many people incorrectly refer to any symptom occurring around the anal area as \"hemorrhoids\", and serious causes of the symptoms should be ruled out. Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is reasonable to confirm the diagnosis and rule out more serious causes.Often, no specific treatment is needed. Initial measures consist of increasing fiber intake, drinking fluids to maintain hydration, NSAIDs to help with pain, and rest. Medicated creams may be applied to the area, but their effectiveness is poorly supported by evidence. A number of minor procedures may be performed if symptoms are severe or do not improve with conservative management. Surgery is reserved for those who fail to improve following these measures.Approximately 50% to 66% of people have problems with hemorrhoids at some point in their lives. Males and females are both affected with about equal frequency. Hemorrhoids affect people most often between 45 and 65 years of age, and they are more common among the wealthy. Outcomes are usually good. The first known mention of the disease is from a 1700 BCE Egyptian papyrus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,15]]},"citation-key":"2021aw","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,13]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1060034563","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Hemorrhoid","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hemorrhoid&oldid=1060034563"},

Phenotypic variation for quantitative traits is, at the most basic level, the result of the segregation of alleles at quantitative trait loci (QTL).  Environmental factors and other external influences can also play a role in phenotypic variation.  Genetic architecture is a broad term that can be described for any given individual based on information regarding gene and allele number, the distribution of allelic and mutational effects, and patterns of pleiotropy, dominance, and epistasis.There are several different experimental views of genetic architecture.  Some researchers recognize that the interplay of various genetic mechanisms is incredibly complex, but believe that these mechanisms can be averaged and treated, more or less, like statistical noise.  Other researchers claim that each and every gene interaction is significant and that it is necessary to measure and model these individual systemic influences on evolutionary genetics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,8]]},"citation-key":"2021j","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,19]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1050672695","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Genetic architecture","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genetic_architecture&oldid=1050672695"},

  {"id":"2021p","abstract":"Locus heterogeneity occurs when mutations at multiple genomic loci are capable of producing the same phenotype (ie. a single trait, pattern of traits, or disorder), and each individual mutation is sufficient to cause the specific phenotype independently. Locus heterogeneity should not be confused with allelic heterogeneity, in which a single phenotype can be produced by multiple mutations, all of which are at the same locus on a chromosome. Likewise, it should not be confused with phenotypic heterogeneity, in which different phenotypes arise among organisms with identical genotypes and environmental conditions. Locus heterogeneity and allelic heterogeneity are the two components of genetic heterogeneity.Locus heterogeneity may have major implications for a number of human diseases. For instance, it has been associated with retinitis pigmentosa, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, osteogenesis imperfecta, and familial hypercholesterolemia.  Heterogenous loci involved in formation of the same phenotype often contribute to similar biological pathways. The role and degree of locus heterogeneity is an important consideration in understanding disease phenotypes and in the development of therapeutic treatment for these diseases.The detection of causal genes for diseases impacted by locus heterogeneity is difficult with genetic analysis methods such as linkage analysis and genome sequencing. These methods rely on comparison of affected family members, but when different family members have different disease-causing genes, such genes may not be accurately identified.

Similarly, two random variables are independent if the realization of one does not affect the probability distribution of the other.\nWhen dealing with collections of more than two events, a weak and a strong notion of independence need to be distinguished. The events are called pairwise independent if any two events in the collection are independent of each other, while saying that the events are mutually independent (or collectively independent) intuitively means that each event is independent of any combination of other events in the collection. A similar notion exists for collections of random variables.\nThe name \"mutual independence\" (same as \"collective independence\") seems the outcome of an educational choice, merely to distinguish the stronger notion from \"pairwise independence\" which is a weaker notion.

  {"id":"2022","abstract":"The Economist is an international weekly newspaper printed in magazine-format and published digitally that focuses on current affairs, international business, politics, and technology. Based in London, the newspaper is owned by The Economist Group, with core editorial offices in the United States, as well as across major cities in continental Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In 2019, its average global print circulation was over 909,476; this, combined with its digital presence, runs to over 1.6 million. Across their social media platforms, it reaches an audience of 35 million, as of 2016. The newspaper has a prominent focus on data journalism and analysis over original reporting, to both criticism and acclaim.\nFounded in 1843, The Economist was first circulated by Scottish economist James Wilson to muster support for abolishing the British Corn Laws (1815–1846), a system of import tariffs. Over time, the newspaper's coverage expanded further into political economy and eventually began running articles on current events, finance, commerce, and British politics. Throughout the mid-to-late 20th century, it greatly expanded its layout and format, adding opinion columns, special reports, political cartoons, reader letters, cover stories, art critique, book reviews, and technology features. The paper is often recognizable by its fire engine red nameplate and illustrated, topical covers. Individual articles are written anonymously, with no byline, in order for the paper to speak as one collective voice. It is supplemented by its sister lifestyle magazine, 1843, and a variety of podcasts, films, and books.\nThe editorial stance of The Economist primarily revolves around classical, social, and most notably economic liberalism. Since its founding, it has supported radical centrism, favouring policies and governments that maintain centrist politics. The newspaper typically champions economic liberalism, particularly free markets, free trade, free immigration, deregulation, and globalisation. Despite a pronounced editorial stance, it is seen as having little reporting bias, and as exercising rigorous fact-checking and strict copyediting. Its extensive use of word play, high subscription prices, and depth of coverage has linked the paper with a high-income and educated readership, drawing both positive and negative connotations. In line with this, it claims to have influential readership of prominent business leaders and policy-makers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,12]]},"citation-key":"2022","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,9]]},"language":"en","note":"Page Version ID: 1064609170","source":"Wikipedia","title":"<i>The Economist</i>","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Economist&oldid=1064609170"},

  {"id":"ackermann2013","abstract":"DNA sequence variation causes changes in gene expression, which in turn has profound effects on cellular states. These variations affect tissue development and may ultimately lead to pathological phenotypes. A genetic locus containing a sequence variation that affects gene expression is called an “expression quantitative trait locus” (eQTL). Whereas the impact of cellular context on expression levels in general is well established, a lot less is known about the cell-state specificity of eQTL. Previous studies differed with respect to how “dynamic eQTL” were defined. Here, we propose a unified framework distinguishing static, conditional and dynamic eQTL and suggest strategies for mapping these eQTL classes. Further, we introduce a new approach to simultaneously infer eQTL from different cell types. By using murine mRNA expression data from four stages of hematopoiesis and 14 related cellular traits, we demonstrate that static, conditional and dynamic eQTL, although derived from the same expression data, represent functionally distinct types of eQTL. While static eQTL affect generic cellular processes, non-static eQTL are more often involved in hematopoiesis and immune response. Our analysis revealed substantial effects of individual genetic variation on cell type-specific expression regulation. Among a total number of 3,941 eQTL we detected 2,729 static eQTL, 1,187 eQTL were conditionally active in one or several cell types, and 70 eQTL affected expression changes during cell type transitions. We also found evidence for feedback control mechanisms reverting the effect of an eQTL specifically in certain cell types. Loci correlated with hematological traits were enriched for conditional eQTL, thus, demonstrating the importance of conditional eQTL for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying physiological trait variation. The classification proposed here has the potential to streamline and unify future analysis of conditional and dynamic eQTL as well as many other kinds of QTL data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Ackermann","given":"Marit"},{"family":"Sikora-Wohlfeld","given":"Weronika"},{"family":"Beyer","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"ackermann2013","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1003514","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,6]]},"language":"en","page":"e1003514","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Impact of Natural Genetic Variation on Gene Expression Dynamics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003514","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"agoglia2021","abstract":"Among primates, humans display a unique trajectory of development that is responsible for the many traits specific to our species. However, the inaccessibility of primary human and chimpanzee tissues has limited our ability to study human evolution. Comparative in vitro approaches using primate-derived induced pluripotent stem cells have begun to reveal species differences on the cellular and molecular levels1,2. In particular, brain organoids have emerged as a promising platform to study primate neural development in vitro3–5, although cross-species comparisons of organoids are complicated by differences in developmental timing and variability of differentiation6,7. Here we develop a new platform to address these limitations by fusing human and chimpanzee induced pluripotent stem cells to generate a panel of tetraploid hybrid stem cells. We applied this approach to study species divergence in cerebral cortical development by differentiating these cells into neural organoids. We found that hybrid organoids provide a controlled system for disentangling cis- and trans-acting gene-expression divergence across cell types and developmental stages, revealing a signature of selection on astrocyte-related genes. In addition, we identified an upregulation of the human somatostatin receptor 2 gene (SSTR2), which regulates neuronal calcium signalling and is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders8,9. We reveal a human-specific response to modulation of SSTR2 function in cortical neurons, underscoring the potential of this platform for elucidating the molecular basis of human evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Agoglia","given":"Rachel M."},{"family":"Sun","given":"Danqiong"},{"family":"Birey","given":"Fikri"},{"family":"Yoon","given":"Se-Jin"},{"family":"Miura","given":"Yuki"},{"family":"Sabatini","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Pașca","given":"Sergiu P."},{"family":"Fraser","given":"Hunter B."}],"citation-key":"agoglia2021","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03343-3","ISSN":"1476-4687","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"language":"en","page":"1-7","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Primate cell fusion disentangles gene regulatory divergence in neurodevelopment","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03343-3"},
  {"id":"aguet2017","abstract":"Characterization of the molecular function of the human genome and its variation across individuals is essential for identifying the cellular mechanisms that underlie human genetic traits and diseases. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Aguet","given":"François"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Andrew A."},{"family":"Castel","given":"Stephane E."},{"family":"Davis","given":"Joe R."},{"family":"He","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Jo","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Mohammadi","given":"Pejman"},{"family":"Park","given":"YoSon"},{"family":"Parsana","given":"Princy"},{"family":"Segrè","given":"Ayellet V."},{"family":"Strober","given":"Benjamin J."},{"family":"Zappala","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Cummings","given":"Beryl B."},{"family":"Gelfand","given":"Ellen T."},{"family":"Hadley","given":"Kane"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Katherine H."},{"family":"Lek","given":"Monkol"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Nedzel","given":"Jared L."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Duyen Y."},{"family":"Noble","given":"Michael S."},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Timothy J."},{"family":"Tukiainen","given":"Taru"},{"family":"MacArthur","given":"Daniel G."},{"family":"Getz","given":"Gad"},{"family":"Addington","given":"Anjene"},{"family":"Guan","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Koester","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Little","given":"A.

  {"id":"alexander2009","abstract":"Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding factor in genetic association studies. Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical correction for population stratification. One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the model-based approach embodied by the widely applied program structure. Another approach, implemented in the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to its remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving problems in minutes that take structure hours. In many of our experiments, we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than the implementation of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together, our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed opens up the possibility of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification in association studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Alexander","given":"David H."},{"family":"Novembre","given":"John"},{"family":"Lange","given":"Kenneth"}],"citation-key":"alexander2009","container-title":"Genome Research","container-title-short":"Genome Res.","DOI":"10.1101/gr.094052.109","ISSN":"1088-9051, 1549-5469","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1655-1664","PMID":"19648217","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Lab","source":"genome.cshlp.org","title":"Fast model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/9/1655","volume":"19"},

Despite rapid advances over recent years, many of the molecular and cellular processes that underlie the progressive loss of healthy physiology are poorly understood2. To gain a better insight into these processes, here we generate a single-cell transcriptomic atlas across the lifespan of Mus musculus that includes data from 23 tissues and organs. We found cell-specific changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age-related changes in the cellular composition of different organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data, we assessed cell-type-specific manifestations of different hallmarks of ageing—such as senescence3, genomic instability4 and changes in the immune system2. This transcriptomic atlas—which we denote Tabula Muris Senis, or ‘Mouse Ageing Cell Atlas’—provides molecular information about how the most important hallmarks of ageing are reflected in a broad range of tissues and cell types.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Almanzar","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Antony","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Baghel","given":"Ankit S."},{"family":"Bakerman","given":"Isaac"},{"family":"Bansal","given":"Ishita"},{"family":"Barres","given":"Ben A."},{"family":"Beachy","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Berdnik","given":"Daniela"},{"family":"Bilen","given":"Biter"},{"family":"Brownfield","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Cain","given":"Corey"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Charles K.

However, resolving the extent, diversity, and quantitative impact of SVs has been challenging. We used long-read nanopore sequencing to capture 238,490 SVs in 100 diverse tomato lines. This panSV genome, along with 14 new reference assemblies, revealed large-scale intermixing of diverse genotypes, as well as thousands of SVs intersecting genes and cis-regulatory regions. Hundreds of SV-gene pairs exhibit subtle and significant expression changes, which could broadly influence quantitative trait variation. By combining quantitative genetics with genome editing, we show how multiple SVs that changed gene dosage and expression levels modified fruit flavor, size, and production. In the last example, higher order epistasis among four SVs affecting three related transcription factors allowed introduction of an important harvesting trait in modern tomato. Our findings highlight the underexplored role of SVs in genotype-to-phenotype relationships and their widespread importance and utility in crop improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Alonge","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xingang"},{"family":"Benoit","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Soyk","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Lara"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Suresh","given":"Hamsini"},{"family":"Ramakrishnan","given":"Srividya"},{"family":"Maumus","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Ciren","given":"Danielle"},{"family":"Levy","given":"Yuval"},{"family":"Harel","given":"Tom Hai"},{"family":"Shalev-Schlosser","given":"Gili"},{"family":"Amsellem","given":"Ziva"},{"family":"Razifard","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Caicedo","given":"Ana L."},{"family":"Tieman","given":"Denise M."},{"family":"Klee","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Kirsche","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Aganezov","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Ranallo-Benavidez","given":"T.

These data document the generality of recombination hotspots, a block-like structure of linkage disequilibrium and low haplotype diversity, leading to substantial correlations of SNPs with many of their neighbours.

  {"id":"andersson2020","abstract":"The proper activities of enhancers and gene promoters are essential for coordinated transcription within a cell. Although diverse methodologies have been developed to identify enhancers and promoters, most have tacitly assumed that these elements are distinct. However, studies have unexpectedly shown that regulatory elements may have both enhancer and promoter functions. Here we review these results, focusing on the factors that determine the promoter and/or enhancer activity of regulatory elements. We discuss emerging models that define regulatory elements by accessible DNA and their non-mutually-exclusive abilities to drive transcription initiation (promoter activity) and/or to enhance transcription at other such regions (enhancer activity). Activating transcriptional regulatory elements have traditionally been categorized into promoters, which define transcription start sites, and enhancers, which act distally to stimulate transcription. In this Review, Andersson and Sandelin discuss the latest findings from methodologies for profiling and testing transcriptional regulatory elements at scale. They explain how the data support an updated, nuanced model that accounts for the numerous overlapping molecular properties of promoters and enhancers.","author":[{"family":"Andersson","given":"Robin"},{"family":"Sandelin","given":"Albin"}],"citation-key":"andersson2020","container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"anzalone2019","abstract":"Most genetic variants that contribute to disease1 are challenging to correct efficiently and without excess byproducts2–5. Here we describe prime editing, a versatile and precise genome editing method that directly writes new genetic information into a specified DNA site using a catalytically impaired Cas9 endonuclease fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase, programmed with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) that both specifies the target site and encodes the desired edit. We performed more than 175 edits in human cells, including targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 types of point mutation, without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. We used prime editing in human cells to correct, efficiently and with few byproducts, the primary genetic causes of sickle cell disease (requiring a transversion in HBB) and Tay–Sachs disease (requiring a deletion in HEXA); to install a protective transversion in PRNP; and to insert various tags and epitopes precisely into target loci. Four human cell lines and primary post-mitotic mouse cortical neurons support prime editing with varying efficiencies. Prime editing shows higher or similar efficiency and fewer byproducts than homology-directed repair, has complementary strengths and weaknesses compared to base editing, and induces much lower off-target editing than Cas9 nuclease at known Cas9 off-target sites. Prime editing substantially expands the scope and capabilities of genome editing, and in principle could correct up to 89% of known genetic variants associated with human diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Anzalone","given":"Andrew V."},{"family":"Randolph","given":"Peyton B."},{"family":"Davis","given":"Jessie R."},{"family":"Sousa","given":"Alexander A."},{"family":"Koblan","given":"Luke W."},{"family":"Levy","given":"Jonathan M."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Newby","given":"Gregory A."},{"family":"Raguram","given":"Aditya"},{"family":"Liu","given":"David R."}],"citation-key":"anzalone2019","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-019-1711-4","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7785","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Genetic engineering;Targeted gene repair\nSubject_term_id: genetic-engineering;targeted-gene-repair","number":"7785","page":"149-157","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Search-and-replace genome editing without double-strand breaks or donor DNA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1711-4","volume":"576"},

Relatively little is understood about the complexity of regulatory evolution accompanying crop domestication, particularly for polyploid plants. Here, we compare the fiber transcriptomes between wild and domesticated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and their reciprocal F1 hybrids, revealing genome-wide (~15%) and often compensatory cis and trans regulatory changes under divergence and domestication. The high level of trans evolution (54%–64%) observed is likely enabled by genomic redundancy following polyploidy. Our results reveal that regulatory variation is significantly associated with sequence evolution, inheritance of parental expression patterns, co-expression gene network properties, and genomic loci responsible for domestication traits. With respect to regulatory evolution, the two subgenomes of allotetraploid cotton are often uncoupled. Overall, our work underscores the complexity of regulatory evolution during fiber domestication and may facilitate new approaches for improving cotton and other polyploid plants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Bao","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Guanjing"},{"family":"Grover","given":"Corrinne E."},{"family":"Conover","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Daojun"},{"family":"Wendel","given":"Jonathan F."}],"citation-key":"bao2019","container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-019-13386-w","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,27]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"5399","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Unraveling cis and trans regulatory evolution during cotton domestication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13386-w","volume":"10"},

Using paired-read sequencing data it is possible to assess the order, distance and orientation of contigs and combine them into so-called scaffolds. Although the latter process is a crucial step in finishing genomes, scaffolding algorithms are often built-in functions in de novo assembly tools and cannot be independently controlled. We here present a new tool, called SSPACE, which is a stand-alone scaffolder of pre-assembled contigs using paired-read data. Main features are: a short runtime, multiple library input of paired-end and/or mate pair datasets and possible contig extension with unmapped sequence reads. SSPACE shows promising results on both prokaryote and eukaryote genomic testsets where the amount of initial contigs was reduced by at least 75%.Availability:www.baseclear.com/bioinformatics-tools/.Contact:walter.pirovano@baseclear.comSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Boetzer","given":"Marten"},{"family":"Henkel","given":"Christiaan V."},{"family":"Jansen","given":"Hans J."},{"family":"Butler","given":"Derek"},{"family":"Pirovano","given":"Walter"}],"citation-key":"boetzer2011","container-title":"Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btq683","ISSN":"1367-4803","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,2,15]]},"page":"578-579","source":"Silverchair","title":"Scaffolding pre-assembled contigs using SSPACE","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq683","volume":"27"},

Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology. But for complex traits, association signals tend to be spread across most of the genome—including near many genes without an obvious connection to disease. We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways.

  {"id":"bravi2020","abstract":"In allosteric proteins, the binding of a ligand modifies function at a distant active site. Such allosteric pathways can be used as target for drug design, generating considerable interest in inferring them from sequence alignment data. Currently, different methods lead to conflicting results, in particular on the existence of long-range evolutionary couplings between distant amino-acids mediating allostery. Here we propose a resolution of this conundrum, by studying epistasis and its inference in models where an allosteric material is evolved in silico to perform a mechanical task. We find in our model the four types of epistasis (Synergistic, Sign, Antagonistic, Saturation), which can be both short or long-range and have a simple mechanical interpretation. We perform a Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) and find that DCA predicts well the cost of point mutations but is a rather poor generative model. Strikingly, it can predict short-range epistasis but fails to capture long-range epistasis, in consistence with empirical findings. We propose that such failure is generic when function requires subparts to work in concert. We illustrate this idea with a simple model, which suggests that other methods may be better suited to capture long-range effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Bravi","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Ravasio","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Brito","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Wyart","given":"Matthieu"}],"citation-key":"bravi2020","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007630","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,2]]},"language":"en","page":"e1007630","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Direct coupling analysis of epistasis in allosteric materials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007630","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"brown2013","abstract":"Genetic variants in cis-regulatory elements or trans-acting regulators frequently influence the quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of gene transcription. Recent interest in expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping has paralleled the adoption of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the analysis of complex traits and disease in humans. Under the hypothesis that many GWAS associations tag non-coding SNPs with small effects, and that these SNPs exert phenotypic control by modifying gene expression, it has become common to interpret GWAS associations using eQTL data. To fully exploit the mechanistic interpretability of eQTL-GWAS comparisons, an improved understanding of the genetic architecture and causal mechanisms of cell type specificity of eQTLs is required. We address this need by performing an eQTL analysis in three parts: first we identified eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types; then we integrated eQTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project; finally we built a set of classifiers to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs. The cell type specificity of eQTLs is associated with eQTL SNP overlap with hundreds of cell type specific CRE classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and many classes of DNA binding proteins. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating the cell type specificity of eQTLs and the mode of regulation of corresponding eQTLs. Using a random forest classifier with cell specific CRE-SNP overlap as features, we demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs. We then demonstrate that CREs from a trait-associated cell type can be used to annotate GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. We anticipate that such integrative, predictive modeling of cell specificity will improve our ability to understand the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Christopher D."},{"family":"Mangravite","given":"Lara M."},{"family":"Engelhardt","given":"Barbara E."}],"citation-key":"brown2013","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1003649","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e1003649","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Integrative Modeling of eQTLs and Cis-Regulatory Elements Suggests Mechanisms Underlying Cell Type Specificity of eQTLs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003649","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"buckler2009","abstract":"Flowering time is a complex trait that controls adaptation of plants to their local environment in the outcrossing species Zea mays (maize). We dissected variation for flowering time with a set of 5000 recombinant inbred lines (maize Nested Association Mapping population, NAM). Nearly a million plants were assayed in eight environments but showed no evidence for any single large-effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Instead, we identified evidence for numerous small-effect QTLs shared among families; however, allelic effects differ across founder lines. We identified no individual QTLs at which allelic effects are determined by geographic origin or large effects for epistasis or environmental interactions. Thus, a simple additive model accurately predicts flowering time for maize, in contrast to the genetic architecture observed in the selfing plant species rice and Arabidopsis.","author":[{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."},{"family":"Holland","given":"James B."},{"family":"Bradbury","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Acharya","given":"Charlotte B."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Browne","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Ersoz","given":"Elhan"},{"family":"Flint-Garcia","given":"Sherry"},{"family":"Garcia","given":"Arturo"},{"family":"Glaubitz","given":"Jeffrey C."},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Major M."},{"family":"Harjes","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Guill","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Kroon","given":"Dallas E."},{"family":"Larsson","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Lepak","given":"Nicholas K."},{"family":"Li","given":"Huihui"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Sharon E."},{"family":"Pressoir","given":"Gael"},{"family":"Peiffer","given":"Jason A."},{"family":"Rosas","given":"Marco Oropeza"},{"family":"Rocheford","given":"Torbert R."},{"family":"Romay","given":"M.

Single-cell transcriptomics have revealed global T cell dysfunction programs in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). However, the majority of TIL do not recognize tumour antigens\n              2\n              , and little is known about transcriptional programs of MANA-specific TIL.

We use their T cell receptors as a ‘barcode’ to track and analyse their transcriptional programs in the tumour microenvironment using coupled single-cell RNA sequencing and T cell receptor sequencing. We find both MANA- and virus-specific clones in TIL, regardless of response, and MANA-, influenza- and Epstein–Barr virus-specific TIL each have unique transcriptional programs. Despite exposure to cognate antigen, MANA-specific TIL express an incompletely activated cytolytic program. MANA-specific CD8 T cells have hallmark transcriptional programs of tissue-resident memory (TRM) cells, but low levels of interleukin-7 receptor (IL-7R) and are functionally less responsive to interleukin-7 (IL-7) compared with influenza-specific TRM cells. Compared with those from responding tumours, MANA-specific clones from non-responding tumours express T cell receptors with markedly lower ligand-dependent signalling, are largely confined to HOBIT\n              high\n              TRM subsets, and coordinately upregulate checkpoints, killer inhibitory receptors and inhibitors of T cell activation. These findings provide important insights for overcoming resistance to PD-1 blockade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Caushi","given":"Justina X."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jiajia"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Zhicheng"},{"family":"Vaghasia","given":"Ajay"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Boyang"},{"family":"Hsiue","given":"Emily Han-Chung"},{"family":"Mog","given":"Brian J."},{"family":"Hou","given":"Wenpin"},{"family":"Justesen","given":"Sune"},{"family":"Blosser","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Tam","given":"Ada"},{"family":"Anagnostou","given":"Valsamo"},{"family":"Cottrell","given":"Tricia R."},{"family":"Guo","given":"Haidan"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Hok Yee"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Dipika"},{"family":"Thapa","given":"Sampriti"},{"family":"Dykema","given":"Arbor G."},{"family":"Burman","given":"Poromendro"},{"family":"Choudhury","given":"Begum"},{"family":"Aparicio","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Cheung","given":"Laurene S."},{"family":"Lanis","given":"Mara"},{"family":"Belcaid","given":"Zineb"},{"family":"El Asmar","given":"Margueritta"},{"family":"Illei","given":"Peter B."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Rulin"},{"family":"Meyers","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Schuebel","given":"Kornel"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Anuj"},{"family":"Skaist","given":"Alyza"},{"family":"Wheelan","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Naidoo","given":"Jarushka"},{"family":"Marrone","given":"Kristen A."},{"family":"Brock","given":"Malcolm"},{"family":"Ha","given":"Jinny"},{"family":"Bush","given":"Errol L."},{"family":"Park","given":"Bernard J."},{"family":"Bott","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Jones","given":"David R."},{"family":"Reuss","given":"Joshua E."},{"family":"Velculescu","given":"Victor E."},{"family":"Chaft","given":"Jamie E."},{"family":"Kinzler","given":"Kenneth W."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Shibin"},{"family":"Vogelstein","given":"Bert"},{"family":"Taube","given":"Janis M."},{"family":"Hellmann","given":"Matthew D."},{"family":"Brahmer","given":"Julie R."},{"family":"Merghoub","given":"Taha"},{"family":"Forde","given":"Patrick M."},{"family":"Yegnasubramanian","given":"Srinivasan"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Hongkai"},{"family":"Pardoll","given":"Drew M."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Kellie N."}],"citation-key":"caushi2021","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03752-4","ISSN":"0028-0836, 1476-4687","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,21]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Transcriptional programs of neoantigen-specific TIL in anti-PD-1-treated lung cancers","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03752-4"},
  {"id":"cavanagh2008","abstract":"The dissection of gene-trait associations and its translation into practice through plant breeding is a central aspect of modern plant biology. The identification of genes underlying simply inherited traits has been very successful. However, the identification of gene-trait associations for complex (multi-genic) traits in crop plants with large, often polyploid genomes has been limited by the absence of appropriate genetic resources that allow quantitative trait loci (QTL) and causal genes to be identified and localised. There has also been a tendency for genetic resources to be developed in germplasm not directly relevant to the breeding community limiting effective implementation. In this review, we discuss approaches to mapping genes and the development of Multi-parent Advanced Generation Inter-cross (MAGIC) populations derived from breeder-relevant germplasm as a platform for a new generation of gene-trait analysis in crop species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Cavanagh","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Morell","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Mackay","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Powell","given":"Wayne"}],"citation-key":"cavanagh2008","collection-title":"Genome studies and Molecular Genetics, edited by Juliette de Meaux and Maarten Koornneef / Plant Biotechnology, edited by Andy Greenland and Jan Leach","container-title":"Current Opinion in Plant Biology","container-title-short":"Current Opinion in Plant Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.pbi.2008.01.002","ISSN":"1369-5266","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"215-221","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"From mutations to MAGIC: resources for gene discovery, validation and delivery in crop plants","title-short":"From mutations to MAGIC","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369526608000162","volume":"11"},

Here, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was conducted in F8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from crossing two common wheats with different spikelet numbers. A total of 15 stable QTL influencing total spikelet number (TSN) and heading date (HD) were detected. Notably, FT-D1, a well-known flowering time gene in wheat, was located within the finely mapped interval of a major QTL on 7DS (QTsn/Hd.cau-7D). A causal indel of one G in the third exon of FT-D1 was significantly associated with total spikelet number and heading date. Consistently, CRISPR/Cas9 mutant lines with homozygous mutations in FT-D1 displayed an increase in total spikelet number and heading date when compared with wild-type. Moreover, one simple and robust marker developed according to the polymorphic site of FT-D1 revealed that this one G indel had been preferentially selected to adapt to different environments. Collectively, these data provide further insights into the genetic basis of spikelet number and heading date, and the diagnostic marker of FT-D1 will be useful for marker-assisted pyramiding in wheat breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhaoyan"},{"family":"Ke","given":"Wensheng"},{"family":"He","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Chai","given":"Lingling"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Xuejiao"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Huanwen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaobo"},{"family":"Du","given":"Dejie"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yidi"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiyong"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Jiewen"},{"family":"Xin","given":"Mingming"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Weilong"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Zhaorong"},{"family":"Su","given":"Zhenqi"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Huiru"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Yingyin"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Qixin"},{"family":"Ni","given":"Zhongfu"}],"citation-key":"chen","container-title":"Plant Biotechnology Journal","DOI":"10.1111/pbi.13773","ISSN":"1467-7652","issue":"n/a","language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/pbi.13773","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A Single Nucleotide Deletion in the Third Exon of FT-D1 Increases the Spikelet Number and Delays Heading Date in Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pbi.13773","volume":"n/a"},

  {"id":"chen2016","abstract":"Motivation: Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only ∼1000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear regression (LR), limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expressions of genes.Results: We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based Gene Expression Omnibus dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms LR with 15.33\n% relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than LR in 99.97\n% of the target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2921 expression profiles. Deep learning still outperforms LR with 6.57\n% relative improvement, and achieves lower error in 81.31\n% of the target genes.Availability and implementation: D-GEX is available at https://github.com/uci-cbcl/D-GEX.Contact:xhx@ics.uci.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yifei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Narayan","given":"Rajiv"},{"family":"Subramanian","given":"Aravind"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Xiaohui"}],"citation-key":"chen2016","container-title":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btw074","ISSN":"1367-4803","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2]]},"page":"1832-1839","title":"Gene expression inference with deep learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw074","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"chen2020","abstract":"Polyploidy is an evolutionary innovation for many animals and all flowering plants, but its impact on selection and domestication remains elusive. Here we analyze genome evolution and diversification for all five allopolyploid cotton species, including economically important Upland and Pima cottons. Although these polyploid genomes are conserved in gene content and synteny, they have diversified by subgenomic transposon exchanges that equilibrate genome size, evolutionary rate heterogeneities and positive selection between homoeologs within and among lineages. These differential evolutionary trajectories are accompanied by gene-family diversification and homoeolog expression divergence among polyploid lineages. Selection and domestication drive parallel gene expression similarities in fibers of two cultivated cottons, involving coexpression networks and N6-methyladenosine RNA modifications. Furthermore, polyploidy induces recombination suppression, which correlates with altered epigenetic landscapes and can be overcome by wild introgression. These genomic insights will empower efforts to manipulate genetic recombination and modify epigenetic landscapes and target genes for crop improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Z.

  {"id":"chen2021","abstract":"Bacterial blight (BB) is a globally devastating rice disease caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The use of disease resistance (R) genes in rice breeding is an effective and economical strategy for the control of this disease. Nevertheless, a majority of R genes lack durable resistance for long-term use under global warming conditions. Here, we report the isolation of a novel executor R gene, Xa7, that confers extremely durable, broad-spectrum, and heat-tolerant resistance to Xoo. The expression of Xa7 was induced by incompatible Xoo strains that secreted the transcription activator-like effector (TALE) AvrXa7 or PthXo3, which recognized effector binding elements (EBEs) in the Xa7 promoter. Furthermore, Xa7 induction was faster and stronger under high temperatures. Overexpression of Xa7 or co-transformation of Xa7 with avrXa7 triggered a hypersensitive response in plants. Constitutive expression of Xa7 activated a defense response in the absence of Xoo but inhibited the growth of transgenic rice plants. In addition, analysis of over 3000 rice varieties showed that the Xa7 locus was found primarily in the indica and aus subgroups. A variation consisting of an 11-bp insertion and a base substitution (G to T) was found in EBEAvrXa7 in the tested varieties, resulting in a loss of Xa7 BB resistance. Through a decade of effort, we have identified an important BB resistance gene and characterized its distinctive interaction with Xoo strains; these findings will greatly facilitate research on the molecular mechanism of Xa7-mediated resistance and promote the use of this valuable gene in breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Xifeng"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Pengcheng"},{"family":"Mei","given":"Le"},{"family":"He","given":"Xiaoling"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Long"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Shurong"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Zhandong"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Xixi"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuchen"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Zhenyu"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Dali"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Bojun"}],"citation-key":"chen2021","collection-title":"Plant-Abiotic/Biotic Interactions","container-title":"Plant Communications","container-title-short":"Plant Communications","DOI":"10.1016/j.xplc.2021.100143","ISSN":"2590-3462","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,10]]},"language":"en","page":"100143","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Xa7, a new executor R gene that confers durable and broad-spectrum resistance to bacterial blight disease in rice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590346221000031","volume":"2"},

However, existing algorithms either collapse heterozygous alleles into one consensus copy or fail to cleanly separate the haplotypes to produce high-quality phased assemblies. Here we describe hifiasm, a de novo assembler that takes advantage of long high-fidelity sequence reads to faithfully represent the haplotype information in a phased assembly graph. Unlike other graph-based assemblers that only aim to maintain the contiguity of one haplotype, hifiasm strives to preserve the contiguity of all haplotypes. This feature enables the development of a graph trio binning algorithm that greatly advances over standard trio binning. On three human and five nonhuman datasets, including California redwood with a ~30-Gb hexaploid genome, we show that hifiasm frequently delivers better assemblies than existing tools and consistently outperforms others on haplotype-resolved assembly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheng","given":"Haoyu"},{"family":"Concepcion","given":"Gregory T."},{"family":"Feng","given":"Xiaowen"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Haowen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Heng"}],"citation-key":"cheng2021a","container-title":"Nature Methods","DOI":"10.1038/s41592-020-01056-5","ISSN":"1548-7105","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","number":"2","page":"170-175","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Haplotype-resolved de novo assembly using phased assembly graphs with hifiasm","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-01056-5","volume":"18"},

Genetics of gene expression (GOGE) studies have identified cis-acting regulatory variants of many genes; however, few trans-acting variants have yet been identified.In humans, ∼30–50% of cis-acting variants identified in immortalized B cells have the same effects in other cell types, such as adipose tissue and blood.Differences in genotype frequencies of regulatory alleles contribute to population differences in gene expression.By combining results from GOGE studies with correlation analysis, one can construct directed gene co-expression networks that provide information on causal rather than just correlative relationships. The results also extend regulatory relationships from pairs to groups of genes.GOGE studies in cells exposed to cellular, medical or environmental perturbations will uncover additional regulators of human gene expression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheung","given":"Vivian G."},{"family":"Spielman","given":"Richard S."}],"citation-key":"cheung2009","container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/nrg2630","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,9]]},"language":"en","number":"9","page":"595-604","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Genetics of human gene expression: mapping DNA variants that influence gene expression","title-short":"Genetics of human gene expression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2630","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"choi2020","abstract":"A polygenic score (PGS) or polygenic risk score (PRS) is an estimate of an individual’s genetic liability to a trait or disease, calculated according to their genotype profile and relevant genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. While present PRSs typically explain only a small fraction of trait variance, their correlation with the single largest contributor to phenotypic variation—genetic liability—has led to the routine application of PRSs across biomedical research. Among a range of applications, PRSs are exploited to assess shared etiology between phenotypes, to evaluate the clinical utility of genetic data for complex disease and as part of experimental studies in which, for example, experiments are performed that compare outcomes (e.g., gene expression and cellular response to treatment) between individuals with low and high PRS values. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRSs become more powerful, PRSs are set to play a key role in research and stratified medicine. However, despite the importance and growing application of PRSs, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here, we provide detailed guidelines for performing and interpreting PRS analyses. We outline standard quality control steps, discuss different methods for the calculation of PRSs, provide an introductory online tutorial, highlight common misconceptions relating to PRS results, offer recommendations for best practice and discuss future challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Choi","given":"Shing Wan"},{"family":"Mak","given":"Timothy Shin-Heng"},{"family":"O’Reilly","given":"Paul F."}],"citation-key":"choi2020","container-title":"Nature Protocols","container-title-short":"Nat Protoc","DOI":"10.1038/s41596-020-0353-1","ISSN":"1750-2799","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Reviews\nSubject_term: Genetic association study;Population genetics;Software\nSubject_term_id: genetic-association-study;population-genetics;software","number":"9","page":"2759-2772","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Tutorial: a guide to performing polygenic risk score analyses","title-short":"Tutorial","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-0353-1","volume":"15"},

A total of 1 233999 regulatory linkages were identified from 99 regulatory factors (TFs, histones and other DNA-binding proteins) and their target genes across seven species. Additionally, this new version added 2449 matrices extracted from ChIP-seq peaks for cis-regulatory element prediction. In addition to integrated ChIP-seq data, four major improvements were provided for more comprehensive information of TF binding events, including (i) 1107 experimentally verified TF matrices from the literature, (ii) gene regulation network comparison between two species, (iii) 3D structures of TFs and TF-DNA complexes and (iv) condition-specific co-expression networks of TFs and their target genes extended to four species.

In large part, this was fueled by advances in genomic technology, enabling us to examine genome-wide genetic variants across diverse genetic materials. The development of the mixed model framework for GWAS dramatically reduced the number of false positives compared with naïve methods. Building on this foundation, many methods have since been developed to increase computational speed or improve statistical power in GWAS. These methods have allowed the detection of genomic variants associated with either traditional agronomic phenotypes or biochemical and molecular phenotypes. In turn, these associations enable applications in gene cloning and in accelerated crop breeding through marker assisted selection or genetic engineering. Current topics of investigation include rare-variant analysis, synthetic associations, optimizing the choice of GWAS model, and utilizing GWAS results to advance knowledge of biological processes.

  {"id":"covarrubias-pazaran2016","abstract":"Most traits of agronomic importance are quantitative in nature, and genetic markers have been used for decades to dissect such traits. Recently, genomic selection has earned attention as next generation sequencing technologies became feasible for major and minor crops. Mixed models have become a key tool for fitting genomic selection models, but most current genomic selection software can only include a single variance component other than the error, making hybrid prediction using additive, dominance and epistatic effects unfeasible for species displaying heterotic effects. Moreover, Likelihood-based software for fitting mixed models with multiple random effects that allows the user to specify the variance-covariance structure of random effects has not been fully exploited. A new open-source R package called sommer is presented to facilitate the use of mixed models for genomic selection and hybrid prediction purposes using more than one variance component and allowing specification of covariance structures. The use of sommer for genomic prediction is demonstrated through several examples using maize and wheat genotypic and phenotypic data. At its core, the program contains three algorithms for estimating variance components: Average information (AI), Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Efficient Mixed Model Association (EMMA). Kernels for calculating the additive, dominance and epistatic relationship matrices are included, along with other useful functions for genomic analysis. Results from sommer were comparable to other software, but the analysis was faster than Bayesian counterparts in the magnitude of hours to days. In addition, ability to deal with missing data, combined with greater flexibility and speed than other REML-based software was achieved by putting together some of the most efficient algorithms to fit models in a gentle environment such as R.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Covarrubias-Pazaran","given":"Giovanny"}],"citation-key":"covarrubias-pazaran2016","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0156744","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"literal":"2016年6月6日"},"language":"en","page":"e0156744","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Genome-Assisted Prediction of Quantitative Traits Using the R Package sommer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156744","volume":"11"},

The findings, based on extensive cross-validations, indicate that models including marker information had higher predictive ability than pedigree-based models. In the wheat data set, and relative to a pedigree model, gains in predictive ability due to inclusion of markers ranged from 7.7 to 35.7%. Correlation between observed and predictive values in the maize data set achieved values up to 0.79. Estimates of marker effects were different across environmental conditions, indicating that genotype × environment interaction is an important component of genetic variability.

  {"id":"cummings2020","abstract":"The acceleration of DNA sequencing in samples from patients and population studies has resulted in extensive catalogues of human genetic variation, but the interpretation of rare genetic variants remains problematic. A notable example of this challenge is the existence of disruptive variants in dosage-sensitive disease genes, even in apparently healthy individuals. Here, by manual curation of putative loss-of-function (pLoF) variants in haploinsufficient disease genes in the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)1, we show that one explanation for this paradox involves alternative splicing of mRNA, which allows exons of a gene to be expressed at varying levels across different cell types. Currently, no existing annotation tool systematically incorporates information about exon expression into the interpretation of variants. We develop a transcript-level annotation metric known as the ‘proportion expressed across transcripts’, which quantifies isoform expression for variants. We calculate this metric using 11,706 tissue samples from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project2 and show that it can differentiate between weakly and highly evolutionarily conserved exons, a proxy for functional importance. We demonstrate that expression-based annotation selectively filters 22.8% of falsely annotated pLoF variants found in haploinsufficient disease genes in gnomAD, while removing less than 4% of high-confidence pathogenic variants in the same genes. Finally, we apply our expression filter to the analysis of de novo variants in patients with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability or developmental disorders to show that pLoF variants in weakly expressed regions have similar effect sizes to those of synonymous variants, whereas pLoF variants in highly expressed exons are most strongly enriched among cases. Our annotation is fast, flexible and generalizable, making it possible for any variant file to be annotated with any isoform expression dataset, and will be valuable for the genetic diagnosis of rare diseases, the analysis of rare variant burden in complex disorders, and the curation and prioritization of variants in recall-by-genotype studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Cummings","given":"Beryl B."},{"family":"Karczewski","given":"Konrad J."},{"family":"Kosmicki","given":"Jack A."},{"family":"Seaby","given":"Eleanor G."},{"family":"Watts","given":"Nicholas A."},{"family":"Singer-Berk","given":"Moriel"},{"family":"Mudge","given":"Jonathan M."},{"family":"Karjalainen","given":"Juha"},{"family":"Satterstrom","given":"F.

In particular, mutations in genes that are required for basic cellular functions and/or reproduction often interfere with the generation of homozygous mutant plants, precluding further functional studies. To overcome this limitation, we devised a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based tissue-specific knockout system, CRISPR-TSKO, enabling the generation of somatic mutations in particular plant cell types, tissues, and organs. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), CRISPR-TSKO mutations in essential genes caused well-defined, localized phenotypes in the root cap, stomatal lineage, or entire lateral roots. The modular cloning system developed in this study allows for the efficient selection, identification, and functional analysis of mutant lines directly in the first transgenic generation. The efficacy of CRISPR-TSKO opens avenues for discovering and analyzing gene functions in the spatial and temporal contexts of plant life while avoiding the pleiotropic effects of system-wide losses of gene function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Decaestecker","given":"Ward"},{"family":"Buono","given":"Rafael Andrade"},{"family":"Pfeiffer","given":"Marie L."},{"family":"Vangheluwe","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Jourquin","given":"Joris"},{"family":"Karimi","given":"Mansour"},{"family":"Van Isterdael","given":"Gert"},{"family":"Beeckman","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Nowack","given":"Moritz K."},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Thomas B."}],"citation-key":"decaestecker2019","container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"The Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1105/tpc.19.00454","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,1]]},"page":"2868-2887","source":"Silverchair","title":"CRISPR-TSKO: A Technique for Efficient Mutagenesis in Specific Cell Types, Tissues, or Organs in Arabidopsis","title-short":"CRISPR-TSKO","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.19.00454","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"dellacqua2015","abstract":"Background: Maize (Zea mays) is a globally produced crop with broad genetic and phenotypic variation. New tools that improve our understanding of the genetic basis of quantitative traits are needed to guide predictive crop breeding. We have produced the first balanced multi-parental population in maize, a tool that provides high diversity and dense recombination events to allow routine quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in maize.\nResults: We produced 1,636 MAGIC maize recombinant inbred lines derived from eight genetically diverse founder lines. The characterization of 529 MAGIC maize lines shows that the population is a balanced, evenly differentiated mosaic of the eight founders, with mapping power and resolution strengthened by high minor allele frequencies and a fast decay of linkage disequilibrium. We show how MAGIC maize may find strong candidate genes by incorporating genome sequencing and transcriptomics data. We discuss three QTL for grain yield and three for flowering time, reporting candidate genes. Power simulations show that subsets of MAGIC maize might achieve high-power and high-definition QTL mapping.\nConclusions: We demonstrate MAGIC maize’s value in identifying the genetic bases of complex traits of agronomic relevance. The design of MAGIC maize allows the accumulation of sequencing and transcriptomics layers to guide the identification of candidate genes for a number of maize traits at different developmental stages. The characterization of the full MAGIC maize population will lead to higher power and definition in QTL mapping, and lay the basis for improved understanding of maize phenotypes, heterosis included.

  {"id":"desai2021","abstract":"Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression (‘noise’) are often considered detrimental, but fluctuations can also be exploited for benefit (e.g., dither). We show here that DNA base-excision repair amplifies transcriptional noise to facilitate cellular reprogramming. Specifically, the DNA-repair protein Apex1, which recognizes both naturally occurring and unnatural base modifications, amplifies expression noise while homeostatically maintaining mean-expression levels. This amplified expression noise originates from shorter duration, higher intensity, transcriptional bursts generated by Apex1-mediated DNA supercoiling. The remodeling of DNA topology first impedes and then accelerates transcription to maintain mean levels. This mechanism, which we term Discordant Transcription through Repair (DiThR; pronounced /’dither’/), potentiates cellular reprogramming and differentiation. Our study reveals a potential functional role for transcriptional fluctuations mediated by DNA base modifications in embryonic development and disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Desai","given":"Ravi V."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xinyue"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Chaturvedi","given":"Sonali"},{"family":"Hwang","given":"Dong Woo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Weihan"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Thomson","given":"Matt"},{"family":"Singer","given":"Robert H."},{"family":"Coleman","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Hansen","given":"Maike M.

  {"id":"dinca2021","abstract":"Plants undergo several developmental transitions during their life cycle. In grapevine, a perennial woody fruit crop, the transition from vegetative/green-to-mature/woody growth involves transcriptomic reprogramming orchestrated by a small group of genes encoding regulators, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We investigated the function of the transcriptional regulator VviNAC33 by generating and characterizing transgenic overexpressing grapevine lines and a chimeric repressor, and by exploring its putative targets through a DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq) approach combined with transcriptomic data. We demonstrated that VviNAC33 induces leaf de-greening, inhibits organ growth and directly activates the expression of STAY-GREEN PROTEIN 1 (SGR1), which is involved in Chl and photosystem degradation, and AUTOPHAGY 8f (ATG8f), which is involved in the maturation of autophagosomes. Furthermore, we show that VviNAC33 directly inhibits AUXIN EFFLUX FACILITATOR PIN1, RopGEF1 and ATP SYNTHASE GAMMA CHAIN 1T (ATPC1), which are involved in photosystem II integrity and activity. Our results show that VviNAC33 plays a major role in terminating photosynthetic activity and organ growth as part of a regulatory network governing the vegetative-to-mature phase transition.","author":[{"family":"D'Incà","given":"Erica"},{"family":"Cazzaniga","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Foresti","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Vitulo","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Bertini","given":"Edoardo"},{"family":"Galli","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Gallavotti","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Pezzotti","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Battista Tornielli","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Zenoni","given":"Sara"}],"citation-key":"dinca2021","container-title":"The New Phytologist","container-title-short":"New Phytol","DOI":"10.1111/nph.17263","ISSN":"1469-8137","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7]]},"language":"eng","page":"726-746","PMCID":"PMC8251598","PMID":"33567124","source":"PubMed","title":"VviNAC33 promotes organ de-greening and represses vegetative growth during the vegetative-to-mature phase transition in grapevine","type":"article-journal","volume":"231"},

In the present study, we show that Bayesian PRS methods can estimate the variance of an individual’s PRS and can yield well-calibrated credible intervals via posterior sampling. For 13 real traits in the UK Biobank (n = 291,273 unrelated ‘white British’), we observe large variances in individual PRS estimates which impact interpretation of PRS-based stratification; averaging across traits, only 0.8% (s.d. = 1.6%) of individuals with PRS point estimates in the top decile have corresponding 95% credible intervals fully contained in the top decile. We provide an analytical estimator for the expectation of individual PRS variance as a function of SNP heritability, number of causal SNPs and sample size.

One important reason for this is that the outcome of a mutation can depend on the genetic context in which it occurs. This dependency is known as epistasis. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to quantify the extent of pairwise and higher-order genetic interactions between mutations through deep mutagenesis of proteins and RNAs. This research has revealed two major components of epistasis: nonspecific genetic interactions caused by nonlinearities in genotype-to-phenotype maps, and specific interactions between particular mutations. Here, we provide an overview of our current understanding of the mechanisms causing epistasis at the molecular level, the consequences of genetic interactions for evolution and genetic prediction, and the applications of epistasis for understanding biology and determining macromolecular structures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Domingo","given":"Júlia"},{"family":"Baeza-Centurion","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Lehner","given":"Ben"}],"citation-key":"domingo2019","container-title":"Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics","container-title-short":"Annu Rev Genom Hum Genet","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-genom-083118-014857","ISSN":"1527-8204","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,8,30]]},"page":"433-460","publisher":"Annual Reviews","source":"annualreviews.org (Atypon)","title":"The Causes and Consequences of Genetic Interactions (Epistasis)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-083118-014857","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"dong2021a","abstract":"Legumes, unlike other plants, have the ability to establish symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. It has been theorized that a unique property of legume root cortical cells enabled the initial establishment of rhizobial symbiosis1–3. Here we show that a SHORTROOT–SCARECROW (SHR–SCR) stem cell program in cortical cells of the legume Medicago truncatula specifies their distinct fate. Regulatory elements drive the cortical expression of SCR, and stele-expressed SHR protein accumulates in cortical cells of M. truncatula but not Arabidopsis thaliana. The cortical SHR–SCR network is conserved across legume species, responds to rhizobial signals, and initiates legume-specific cortical cell division for de novo nodule organogenesis and accommodation of rhizobia. Ectopic activation of SHR and SCR in legumes is sufficient to induce root cortical cell division. Our work suggests that acquisition of the cortical SHR–SCR module enabled cell division coupled to rhizobial infection in legumes. We propose that this event was central to the evolution of rhizobial endosymbiosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Dong","given":"Wentao"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Yayun"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Huizhong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chunhua"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Jincai"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Jinpeng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Weibing"},{"family":"Lan","given":"Liying"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuru"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaowei"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Huiling"},{"family":"Miao","given":"Yuchen"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Lin"},{"family":"He","given":"Zuhua"},{"family":"Song","given":"Chunpeng"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shuang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Dong"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ertao"}],"citation-key":"dong2021a","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-3016-z","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7843","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Evolutionary developmental biology;Plant development;Plant symbiosis\nSubject_term_id: evolutionary-developmental-biology;plant-development;plant-symbiosis","number":"7843","page":"586-590","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"An SHR–SCR module specifies legume cortical cell fate to enable nodulation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-3016-z","volume":"589"},

  {"id":"dudbridge2008","abstract":"The question of what significance threshold is appropriate for genomewide association studies is somewhat unresolved. Previous theoretical suggestions have yet to be validated in practice, whereas permutation testing does not resolve a discrepancy between the genomewide multiplicity of the experiment and the subset of markers actually tested. We used genotypes from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium to estimate a genomewide significance threshold for the UK Caucasian population. We subsampled the genotypes at increasing densities, using permutation to estimate the nominal P-value for 5% family-wise error. By extrapolating to infinite density, we estimated the genomewide significance threshold to be about 7.2 × 10−8. To reduce the computation time, we considered Patterson's eigenvalue estimator of the effective number of tests, but found it to be an order of magnitude too low for multiplicity correction. However, by fitting a Beta distribution to the minimum P-value from permutation replicates, we showed that the effective number is a useful heuristic and suggest that its estimation in this context is an open problem. We conclude that permutation is still needed to obtain genomewide significance thresholds, but with subsampling, extrapolation and estimation of an effective number of tests, the threshold can be standardized for all studies of the same population.

We evaluated whether a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of 1167 phenotypes in >360,000 U.K. Biobank individuals, in combination with gene expression and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in 48 tissues, can inform prediction of drug side effects in clinical trials. We determined that drug target genes with five genetic features—tissue specificity of gene expression, Mendelian associations, phenotype- and tissue-level effects of genome-wide association (GWA) loci driven by eQTL, and genetic constraint—confer a 2.6-fold greater risk of side effects, compared to genes without such features. The presence of eQTL in multiple tissues resulted in more unique phenotypes driven by GWA loci, suggesting that drugs delivered to multiple tissues can induce several side effects. We demonstrate the utility of PheWAS and eQTL data from multiple tissues for informing drug side effect prediction and highlight the need for tissue-specific drug delivery.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Duffy","given":"Áine"},{"family":"Verbanck","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Dobbyn","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Won","given":"Hong-Hee"},{"family":"Rein","given":"Joshua L."},{"family":"Forrest","given":"Iain S."},{"family":"Nadkarni","given":"Girish"},{"family":"Rocheleau","given":"Ghislain"},{"family":"Do","given":"Ron"}],"citation-key":"duffy2020","container-title":"Science Advances","container-title-short":"Sci.

We characterized 130 of the most active mobile element source elements and found that 63% of all SVs arise through homology-mediated mechanisms.

  {"id":"endelman2011","abstract":"Many important traits in plant breeding are polygenic and therefore recalcitrant to traditional marker-assisted selection. Genomic selection addresses this complexity by including all markers in the prediction model. A key method for the genomic prediction of breeding values is ridge regression (RR), which is equivalent to best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) when the genetic covariance between lines is proportional to their similarity in genotype space. This additive model can be broadened to include epistatic effects by using other kernels, such as the Gaussian, which represent inner products in a complex feature space. To facilitate the use of RR and nonadditive kernels in plant breeding, a new software package for R called rrBLUP has been developed. At its core is a fast maximum-likelihood algorithm for mixed models with a single variance component besides the residual error, which allows for efficient prediction with unreplicated training data. Use of the rrBLUP software is demonstrated through several examples, including the identification of optimal crosses based on superior progeny value. In cross-validation tests, the prediction accuracy with nonadditive kernels was significantly higher than RR for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield but equivalent for several maize (Zea mays L.) traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Endelman","given":"Jeffrey B."}],"citation-key":"endelman2011","container-title":"The Plant Genome","DOI":"10.3835/plantgenome2011.08.0024","ISSN":"1940-3372","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3835/plantgenome2011.08.0024","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Ridge Regression and Other Kernels for Genomic Selection with R Package rrBLUP","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3835/plantgenome2011.08.0024","volume":"4"},

We present a novel population consisting of 50 introgression lines (ILs) originating from a cross between the green-fruited species Lycopersicon pennellii and the cultivated tomato (cv M82). Each of the lines contains a single homozygous restriction fragment length polymorphism-defined L. pennellii chromosome segment, and together the lines provide complete coverage of the genome and a set of lines nearly isogenic to M82. A field trial of the ILs and their hybrids revealed at least 23 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for total soluble solids content and 18 for fruit mass; these estimates are twice as high as previously reported estimates based on traditional mapping populations. For finer mapping of a QTL affecting fruit mass, the introgressed segment was recombined into smaller fragments that allowed the identification of three linked loci. At least 16 QTL for plant weight, 22 for percentage green fruit weight, 11 for total yield and 14 for total soluble solids yield were identified.

In principle, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a platform for detecting genetic interactions, but existing methods for identifying them from GWAS data tend to focus on testing individual locus pairs, which undermines statistical power. Importantly, a global genetic network mapped for a model eukaryotic organism revealed that genetic interactions often connect genes between compensatory functional modules in a highly coherent manner. Taking advantage of this expected structure, we developed a computational approach called BridGE that identifies pathways connected by genetic interactions from GWAS data. Applying BridGE broadly, we discover significant interactions in Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, hypertension, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and type 2 diabetes. Our novel approach provides a general framework for mapping complex genetic networks underlying human disease from genome-wide genotype data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Fang","given":"Gang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wen"},{"family":"Paunic","given":"Vanja"},{"family":"Heydari","given":"Hamed"},{"family":"Costanzo","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaoye"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaotong"},{"family":"VanderSluis","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Oately","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Steinbach","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Van Ness","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Schadt","given":"Eric E."},{"family":"Pankratz","given":"Nathan D."},{"family":"Boone","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Vipin"},{"family":"Myers","given":"Chad L."}],"citation-key":"fang2019","container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-019-12131-7","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,9,19]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"4274","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Discovering genetic interactions bridging pathways in genome-wide association studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12131-7","volume":"10"},

  {"id":"feng2021","abstract":"Gossypium arboreum (2n=2x=26, A(2)), the putative progenitor of the A(t)-subgenome of Gossypium hirsutum (2n=4x=52, AD), is a repository of genes of interesting that have been eliminated during evolution/domestication of G. hirsutum. However, its valuable genes remain untapped so far due to species isolation. Here, using a synthetic amphiploid (AADDA(2)A(2)) previously reported, we developed a set of 289 G. arboreum chromosome segment introgression lines (ILs) in G. hirsutum by expanding the backcrossing population and through precise marker-assisted selection (MAS) although complex chromosomal structural variations existed between parents which severely hindered introgression. Our results showed the total coverage length of introgressed segments was 1,116.29Mb, representing 78.48% of the A(t)-subgenome in the G. hirsutum background, with an average segment-length of 8.69Mb. A total of 81 co- quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield and fiber quality were identified by both the RSTEP-ADD-based QTL mapping and the genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis, with 1.01-24.78% of the phenotypic variance explained. Most QTLs for boll traits showed negative additive effects, but G. arboreum still has the potential to improve boll-number traits in G. hirsutum. Most QTLs for fiber quality showed negative additive effects, implying these QTLs were domesticated in G. hirsutum compared with G. arboreum and, a small quantity of fiber quality QTLs showing positive additive effects, conversely; however, indicates that G. arboreum has the underlying genes of enhancing fiber quality of G. hirsutum. This study provides new insights into the breeding genetic potential of G. arboreum, lays the foundation for further mining favorable genes of interest, and provides guidance for inter-ploidy gene transference from relatives into cultivated crops.","author":[{"family":"Feng","given":"Liuchun"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Min"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Yue","given":"Haoran"},{"family":"Su","given":"Qiao"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Chenhui"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Guoli"},{"family":"Ai","given":"Nijiang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ningshan"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Baoliang"}],"citation-key":"feng2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Plant Science","DOI":"10.3389/fpls.2021.719371","ISSN":"1664-462X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,2]]},"note":"WOS:000684955200006","page":"719371","title":"Genome-Wide Introgression and Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping Reveals the Potential of Asian Cotton (Gossypium arboreum) in Improving Upland Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"ferguson2020","abstract":"Sorghum is a model C4 crop made experimentally tractable by extensive genomic and genetic resources. Biomass sorghum is also studied as a feedstock for biofuel and forage. Mechanistic modelling suggests that reducing stomatal conductance (gs) could improve sorghum intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) and biomass production. Phenotyping for discovery of genotype to phenotype associations remain bottlenecks in efforts to understand the mechanistic basis for natural variation in gs and iWUE. This study addressed multiple methodological limitations. Optical tomography and a novel machine learning tool were combined to measure stomatal density (SD). This was combined with rapid measurements of leaf photosynthetic gas exchange and specific leaf area (SLA). These traits were then the subject of genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) across 869 field-grown biomass sorghum accessions. SD was correlated with plant height and biomass production. Plasticity in SD and SLA were interrelated with each other, and productivity, across wet versus dry growing seasons. Moderate-to-high heritability of traits studied across the large mapping population supported identification of associations between DNA sequence variation, or RNA transcript abundance, and trait variation. 394 unique genes underpinning variation in WUE-related traits are described with higher confidence because they were identified in multiple independent tests. This list was enriched in genes whose orthologs in Arabidopsis have functions related to stomatal or leaf development and leaf gas exchange. These advances in methodology and knowledge will aid efforts to improve the WUE of C4 crops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferguson","given":"John N."},{"family":"Fernandes","given":"Samuel B."},{"family":"Monier","given":"Brandon"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Nathan D."},{"family":"Allan","given":"Dylan"},{"family":"Dmitrieva","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Schmuker","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Lozano","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Valluru","given":"Ravi"},{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."},{"family":"Gore","given":"Michael A."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Spalding","given":"Edgar P."},{"family":"Leakey","given":"Andrew D.

However, productivity varies greatly across the globe and is under threat from both increased competitions for land and climate change and associated environmental deterioration. Moreover, the increase in human population size and dietary changes are putting an ever greater burden on agriculture. The majority of this burden is met by the cultivation of a very small number of species, largely in locations that differ from their origin of domestication. Recent technological advances have raised the possibility of de novo domestication of wild plants as a viable solution for designing ideal crops while maintaining food security and a more sustainable low-input agriculture.

It is here attempted to ascertain the biometrical properties of a population of a more general type than has hitherto been examined, inheritance in which follows this scheme. It is hoped that in this way it will be possible to make a more exact analysis of the causes of human variability. The great body of available statistics show us that the deviations of a human measurement from its mean follow very closely the Normal Law of Errors, and, therefore, that the variability may be uniformly measured by the standard deviation corresponding to the square root of the mean square error. When there are two independent causes of variability capable of producing in an otherwise uniform population distributions with standard deviations σ\n              1\n              and σ\n              2\n              , it is found that the distribution, when both causes act together, has a standard deviation\n              \n              . It is therefore desirable in analysing the causes of variability to deal with the square of the standard deviation as the measure of variability. We shall term this quantity the Variance of the normal population to which it refers, and we may now ascribe to the constituent causes fractions or percentages of the total variance which they together produce. It is desirable on the one hand that the elementary ideas at the basis of the calculus of correlations should be clearly understood, and easily expressed in ordinary language, and on the other that loose phrases about the “percentage of causation,” which obscure the essential distinction between the individual and the population, should be carefully avoided.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Fisher","given":"R.

Before this potential can be realized, we must understand the nature of linkage disequilibrium (LD) within a genome.

Recently, association mapping has been exploited to dissect quantitative trait loci (QTL). With the exception of maize and Arabidopsis, little research has been conducted on LD in plants. The mating system of the species (selfing versus outcrossing), and phenomena such as population structure and recombination hot spots, can strongly influence patterns of LD.

We present a tomato pan-genome constructed using genome sequences of 725 phylogenetically and geographically representative accessions, revealing 4,873 genes absent from the reference genome.

Lost or negatively selected genes are enriched for important traits, especially disease resistance. We identify a rare allele in the TomLoxC promoter selected against during domestication. Quantitative trait locus mapping and analysis of transgenic plants reveal a role for TomLoxC in apocarotenoid production, which contributes to desirable tomato flavor. In orange-stage fruit, accessions harboring both the rare and common TomLoxC alleles (heterozygotes) have higher TomLoxC expression than those homozygous for either and are resurgent in modern tomatoes.

  {"id":"gao2021b","abstract":"Plant immunity is activated upon pathogen perception and often affects growth and yield when it is constitutively active. How plants ﬁne-tune immune homeostasis in their natural habitats remains elusive. Here, we discover a conserved immune suppression network in cereals that orchestrates immune homeostasis, centering on a Ca2+-sensor, RESISTANCE OF RICE TO DISEASES1 (ROD1). ROD1 promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging by stimulating catalase activity, and its protein stability is regulated by ubiquitination. ROD1 disruption confers resistance to multiple pathogens, whereas a natural ROD1 allele prevalent in indica rice with agroecology-speciﬁc distribution enhances resistance without yield penalty. The fungal effector AvrPiz-t structurally mimics ROD1 and activates the same ROS-scavenging cascade to suppress host immunity and promote virulence. We thus reveal a molecular framework adopted by both host and pathogen that integrates Ca2+ sensing and ROS homeostasis to suppress plant immunity, suggesting a principle for breeding disease-resistant, high-yield crops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Gao","given":"Mingjun"},{"family":"He","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Xiangbin"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Bingxiao"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaoyuan"},{"family":"Zhai","given":"Keran"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yifeng"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Xiangyu"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Huizhong"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Shenghan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jiyun"},{"family":"Yue","given":"Jiaxing"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Jianlong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guiquan"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Yiwen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ertao"},{"family":"Tharreau","given":"Didier"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Guo-Liang"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Weibing"},{"family":"He","given":"Zuhua"}],"citation-key":"gao2021b","container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2021.09.009","ISSN":"00928674","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10]]},"language":"en","page":"5391-5404.e17","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ca2+ sensor-mediated ROS scavenging suppresses rice immunity and is exploited by a fungal effector","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867421010564","volume":"184"},

However, current algorithms for phased assembly either do not generate chromosome-scale phasing or require pedigree information, which limits their application. We present a method named diploid assembly (DipAsm) that uses long, accurate reads and long-range conformation data for single individuals to generate a chromosome-scale phased assembly within 1 day. Applied to four public human genomes, PGP1, HG002, NA12878 and HG00733, DipAsm produced haplotype-resolved assemblies with minimum contig length needed to cover 50% of the known genome (NG50) up to 25 Mb and phased ~99.5% of heterozygous sites at 98–99% accuracy, outperforming other approaches in terms of both contiguity and phasing completeness. We demonstrate the importance of chromosome-scale phased assemblies for the discovery of structural variants (SVs), including thousands of new transposon insertions, and of highly polymorphic and medically important regions such as the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) regions. DipAsm will facilitate high-quality precision medicine and studies of individual haplotype variation and population diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Garg","given":"Shilpa"},{"family":"Fungtammasan","given":"Arkarachai"},{"family":"Carroll","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Chou","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Schmitt","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Mac","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Peluso","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Hatas","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Ghurye","given":"Jay"},{"family":"Maguire","given":"Jared"},{"family":"Mahmoud","given":"Medhat"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Haoyu"},{"family":"Heller","given":"David"},{"family":"Zook","given":"Justin M."},{"family":"Moemke","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Marschall","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Sedlazeck","given":"Fritz J."},{"family":"Aach","given":"John"},{"family":"Chin","given":"Chen-Shan"},{"family":"Church","given":"George M."},{"family":"Li","given":"Heng"}],"citation-key":"garg2021","container-title":"Nature Biotechnology","DOI":"10.1038/s41587-020-0711-0","ISSN":"1546-1696","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3]]},"language":"en","number":"3","page":"309-312","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Chromosome-scale, haplotype-resolved assembly of human genomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0711-0","volume":"39"},

Transcriptome-wide association analysis in arteries identifies one additional locus (SLC24A3). We characterize open chromatin in arterial primary cells and find that FMD associated variants are located in arterial-specific regulatory elements. Target genes are broadly involved in mechanisms related to actin cytoskeleton and intracellular calcium homeostasis, central to vascular contraction. We find significant genetic overlap between FMD and more common cardiovascular diseases and traits including blood pressure, migraine, intracranial aneurysm, and coronary artery disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Georges","given":"Adrien"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Min-Lee"},{"family":"Berrandou","given":"Takiy-Eddine"},{"family":"Bakker","given":"Mark K."},{"family":"Dikilitas","given":"Ozan"},{"family":"Kiando","given":"Soto Romuald"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Lijiang"},{"family":"Satterfield","given":"Benjamin A."},{"family":"Sengupta","given":"Sebanti"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Mengyao"},{"family":"Deleuze","given":"Jean-François"},{"family":"Dupré","given":"Delia"},{"family":"Hunker","given":"Kristina L."},{"family":"Kyryachenko","given":"Sergiy"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Sayoud-Sadeg","given":"Ines"},{"family":"Amar","given":"Laurence"},{"family":"Brummett","given":"Chad M."},{"family":"Coleman","given":"Dawn M."},{"family":"Escamard","given":"Valentina","non-dropping-particle":"d’"},{"family":"Leeuw","given":"Peter","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Fendrikova-Mahlay","given":"Natalia"},{"family":"Kadian-Dodov","given":"Daniella"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jun Z."},{"family":"Lorthioir","given":"Aurélien"},{"family":"Pappaccogli","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Prejbisz","given":"Aleksander"},{"family":"Smigielski","given":"Witold"},{"family":"Stanley","given":"James C."},{"family":"Zawistowski","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Zöllner","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Leeuw","given":"Peter","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Amouyel","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"De Buyzere","given":"Marc L."},{"family":"Debette","given":"Stéphanie"},{"family":"Dobrowolski","given":"Piotr"},{"family":"Drygas","given":"Wojciech"},{"family":"Gornik","given":"Heather L."},{"family":"Olin","given":"Jeffrey W."},{"family":"Piwonski","given":"Jerzy"},{"family":"Rietzschel","given":"Ernst R."},{"family":"Ruigrok","given":"Ynte M."},{"family":"Vikkula","given":"Miikka"},{"family":"Warchol Celinska","given":"Ewa"},{"family":"Januszewicz","given":"Andrzej"},{"family":"Kullo","given":"Iftikhar J."},{"family":"Azizi","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Jeunemaitre","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Persu","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Kovacic","given":"Jason C."},{"family":"Ganesh","given":"Santhi K."},{"family":"Bouatia-Naji","given":"Nabila"}],"citation-key":"georges2021","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-26174-2","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,15]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Cardiovascular diseases;Genetics research;Genome-wide association studies\nSubject_term_id: cardiovascular-diseases;genetics-research;genome-wide-association-studies","number":"1","page":"6031","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Genetic investigation of fibromuscular dysplasia identifies risk loci and shared genetics with common cardiovascular diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26174-2","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"giambartolomei2014","abstract":"Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study (GWAS) design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits, in particular cardiovascular diseases and lipid biomarkers. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including >100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results, hence highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In three cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs (SYPL2, IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with SORT1, GCKR, and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (implemented online at http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases as well as the design of drugs to target disease pathways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Giambartolomei","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Vukcevic","given":"Damjan"},{"family":"Schadt","given":"Eric E."},{"family":"Franke","given":"Lude"},{"family":"Hingorani","given":"Aroon D."},{"family":"Wallace","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Plagnol","given":"Vincent"}],"citation-key":"giambartolomei2014","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1004383","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,15]]},"language":"en","page":"e1004383","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Bayesian Test for Colocalisation between Pairs of Genetic Association Studies Using Summary Statistics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004383","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"gibson2012","abstract":"For the past couple of years, discussion of the so-called 'missing heritability problem' has focused attention on the failure of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to discover more than a minor fraction of the genetic variance for complex traits and disease susceptibility.However, it now appears that the problem is largely a result of the small contribution of most variants, either because the variants are too rare to contribute population-wide, or because the effect sizes of common variants are, in general, very small.This Review presents five arguments for, and five against, each of these two models and concludes that although the infinitesimal model is essentially correct, rare alleles of large effect almost certainly also make an essential contribution to risk of disease. Some of the more important arguments are listed below.Standard evolutionary and quantitative genetic theory both provide strong expectations for rare and common variant contributions. There is also increasingly solid empirical evidence for both classes of contribution.Neither model can yet be said to provide compelling explanations for epidemiological transitions and other demographic phenomena, including familial clustering and sibling resemblance.Mechanistic explanations for additive within-locus effects and multiplicative between-locus effects are ultimately desired to complement a purely statistical description of effects. In either model, the majority of healthy individuals carry disease-associated alleles.Although common variants may establish the background liability to many complex diseases, environmental and rare variant perturbations often provide the extra impetus that pushes an individual over the disease threshold.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Gibson","given":"Greg"}],"citation-key":"gibson2012","container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Genet","DOI":"10.1038/nrg3118","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,2]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Reviews\nSubject_term: Disease genetics;Genetic models;Genome-wide association studies;Population genetics;Rare variants\nSubject_term_id: disease-genetics;genetic-models;genome-wide-association-studies;population-genetics;rare-variants","number":"2","page":"135-145","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Rare and common variants: twenty arguments","title-short":"Rare and common variants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3118","volume":"13"},

However, our ability to link divergent regulation to divergent phenotypes is limited. Here, we utilized human–chimpanzee hybrid induced pluripotent stem cells to study gene expression separating these species. The tetraploid hybrid cells allowed us to separate cis- from trans-regulatory effects, and to control for nongenetic confounding factors. We differentiated these cells into cranial neural crest cells, the primary cell type giving rise to the face. We discovered evidence of lineage-specific selection on the hedgehog signaling pathway, including a human-specific sixfold down-regulation of EVC2 (LIMBIN), a key hedgehog gene. Inducing a similar down-regulation of EVC2 substantially reduced hedgehog signaling output. Mice and humans lacking functional EVC2 show striking phenotypic parallels to human–chimpanzee craniofacial differences, suggesting that the regulatory divergence of hedgehog signaling may have contributed to the unique craniofacial morphology of humans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Gokhman","given":"David"},{"family":"Agoglia","given":"Rachel M."},{"family":"Kinnebrew","given":"Maia"},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Danqiong"},{"family":"Bajpai","given":"Vivek K."},{"family":"Naqvi","given":"Sahin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Coral"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Chider"},{"family":"Petrov","given":"Dmitri A."},{"family":"Ahituv","given":"Nadav"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Honghao"},{"family":"Mishina","given":"Yuji"},{"family":"Wysocka","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Rohatgi","given":"Rajat"},{"family":"Fraser","given":"Hunter B."}],"citation-key":"gokhman2021","container-title":"Nature Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00804-3","ISSN":"1546-1718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,17]]},"language":"en","page":"1-10","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Human–chimpanzee fused cells reveal cis -regulatory divergence underlying skeletal evolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00804-3"},
  {"id":"goldberg2021","abstract":"\"The science of genetics is less than 150 years old, but its accomplishments within that short time have been astonishing. Gregor Mendel first described genes as abstract units of inheritance in 1865; his work was ignored and then rediscovered in 1900. Thomas Hunt Morgan and his students provided experimental verification of the idea that genes reside within chromosomes during the years 1910-1920. By 1944, Oswald Avery and his coworkers had established that genes are made of DNA. James Watson and Francis Crick published their pathbreaking structure of DNA in 1953. Remarkably, less than 50 years later (in 2001), an international consortium of investigators deciphered the sequence of the 3 billion nucleotides in the human genome. Twentieth century genetics made it possible to identify individual genes and to understand a great deal about their functions. Today, scientists are able to access the enormous amounts of genetic data generated by the sequencing of many organisms' genomes. Analysis of these data will result in a deeper understanding of the complex molecular interactions within and among vast networks of genes, proteins, and other molecules that help bring organisms to life. Finding new methods and tools for analyzing these data will be a significant part of genetics in the twenty-first century. Our seventh edition of Genetics: From Genes to Genomes emphasizes both the core concepts of genetics and the cutting-edge discoveries, modern tools, and analytic methods that will keep the science of genetics moving forward. The authors of the seventh edition have worked together in revising every chapter in an effort not only to provide the most up-to-date information, but also to provide continuity and the clearest possible explanations of difficult concepts in one voice\"--","author":[{"family":"Goldberg","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Hartwell","given":"Leland H."},{"family":"Fischer","given":"Janice A."},{"family":"Hood","given":"Leroy E."}],"citation-key":"goldberg2021","edition":"Seventh edition","event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-1-260-57582-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","publisher":"McGraw Hill Education","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Genetics: from genes to genomes","title-short":"Genetics","type":"book"},

We used integrative analysis to develop a unified set of chromatin state annotations, infer the identities of dynamic enhancers and key transcriptional regulators, and characterize the relationship between chromatin state and accessibility during developmental gene regulation. We also leveraged these data to link enhancers to putative target genes and demonstrate tissue-specific enrichments of sequence variants associated with disease in humans.

Here we assayed gene expression in rice (Oryza sativa)3, and used phenotypic selection analysis to estimate the type and strength of selection on the levels of more than 15,000 transcripts4,5. Variation in most transcripts appears (nearly) neutral or under very weak stabilizing selection in wet paddy conditions (with median standardized selection differentials near zero), but selection is stronger under drought conditions. Overall, more transcripts are conditionally neutral (2.83%) than are antagonistically pleiotropic6 (0.04%), and transcripts that display lower levels of expression and stochastic noise7–9 and higher levels of plasticity9 are under stronger selection. Selection strength was further weakly negatively associated with levels of cis-regulation and network connectivity9. Our multivariate analysis suggests that selection acts on the expression of photosynthesis genes4,5, but that the efficacy of selection is genetically constrained under drought conditions10. Drought selected for earlier flowering11,12 and a higher expression of OsMADS18 (Os07g0605200), which encodes a MADS-box transcription factor and is a known regulator of early flowering13—marking this gene as a drought-escape gene11,12.

  {"id":"grubert2020","abstract":"Physical interactions between distal regulatory elements have a key role in regulating gene expression, but the extent to which these interactions vary between cell types and contribute to cell-type-specific gene expression remains unclear. Here, to address these questions as part of phase III of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), we mapped cohesin-mediated chromatin loops, using chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), and analysed gene expression in 24 diverse human cell types, including core ENCODE cell lines. Twenty-eight per cent of all chromatin loops vary across cell types; these variations modestly correlate with changes in gene expression and are effective at grouping cell types according to their tissue of origin. The connectivity of genes corresponds to different functional classes, with housekeeping genes having few contacts, and dosage-sensitive genes being more connected to enhancer elements. This atlas of chromatin loops complements the diverse maps of regulatory architecture that comprise the ENCODE Encyclopedia, and will help to support emerging analyses of genome structure and function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Grubert","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Srivas","given":"Rohith"},{"family":"Spacek","given":"Damek V."},{"family":"Kasowski","given":"Maya"},{"family":"Ruiz-Velasco","given":"Mariana"},{"family":"Sinnott-Armstrong","given":"Nasa"},{"family":"Greenside","given":"Peyton"},{"family":"Narasimha","given":"Anil"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Geller","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Sanghi","given":"Akshay"},{"family":"Kulik","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Sa","given":"Silin"},{"family":"Rabinovitch","given":"Marlene"},{"family":"Kundaje","given":"Anshul"},{"family":"Dalton","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Zaugg","given":"Judith B."},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"grubert2020","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2151-x","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7818","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"language":"en","number":"7818","page":"737-743","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Landscape of cohesin-mediated chromatin loops in the human genome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2151-x","volume":"583"},

While genetic association studies have successfully identified common genetic variants associated with susceptibility, these studies are not practical for identifying rare variants\n              1,5\n              . Efforts to distinguish pathogenic variants from benign rare variants have leveraged the genetic code to identify deleterious protein-coding alleles\n              1,6,7\n              , but no analogous code exists for non-coding variants. Therefore, ascertaining which rare variants have phenotypic effects remains a major challenge. Rare non-coding variants have been associated with extreme gene expression in studies using single tissues\n              8,9,10,11\n              , but their effects across tissues are unknown. Here we identify gene expression outliers, or individuals showing extreme expression levels for a particular gene, across 44 human tissues by using combined analyses of whole genomes and multi-tissue RNA-sequencing data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project v6p release\n              12\n              . We find that 58% of underexpression and 28% of overexpression outliers have nearby conserved rare variants compared to 8% of non-outliers. Additionally, we developed RIVER (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation), a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates expression data to predict a regulatory effect for rare variants with higher accuracy than models using genomic annotations alone. Overall, we demonstrate that rare variants contribute to large gene expression changes across tissues and provide an integrative method for interpretation of rare variants in individual genomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,11]]},"author":[{"literal":"GTEx Consortium"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Yungil"},{"family":"Tsang","given":"Emily K."},{"family":"Davis","given":"Joe R."},{"family":"Damani","given":"Farhan N."},{"family":"Chiang","given":"Colby"},{"family":"Hess","given":"Gaelen T."},{"family":"Zappala","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Strober","given":"Benjamin J."},{"family":"Scott","given":"Alexandra J."},{"family":"Li","given":"Amy"},{"family":"Ganna","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Bassik","given":"Michael C."},{"family":"Merker","given":"Jason D."},{"family":"Hall","given":"Ira M."},{"family":"Battle","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Montgomery","given":"Stephen B."}],"citation-key":"gtexconsortium2017","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature24267","ISSN":"0028-0836, 1476-4687","issue":"7675","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,12]]},"language":"en","page":"239-243","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The impact of rare variation on gene expression across tissues","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/nature24267","volume":"550"},

We identified 157 TWAS-significant genes, of which 35 did not overlap a known GWAS locus. Of these 157 genes, 42 were associated with specific chromatin features measured in independent samples, thus highlighting potential regulatory targets for follow-up. Suppression of one identified susceptibility gene, mapk3, in zebrafish showed a significant effect on neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Expression and splicing from the brain captured most of the TWAS effect across all genes.

  {"id":"hafemeister2019","abstract":"Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data exhibits significant cell-to-cell variation due to technical factors, including the number of molecules detected in each cell, which can confound biological heterogeneity with technical effects. To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Hafemeister","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Satija","given":"Rahul"}],"citation-key":"hafemeister2019","container-title":"Genome Biology","container-title-short":"Genome Biology","DOI":"10.1186/s13059-019-1874-1","ISSN":"1474-760X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,23]]},"page":"296","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1874-1","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"haley1992","abstract":"The use of flanking marker methods has proved to be a powerful tool for the mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the segregating generations derived from crosses between inbred lines. Methods to analyse these data, based on maximum-likelihood, have been developed and provide good estimates of QTL effects in some situations. Maximum-likelihood methods are, however, relatively complex and can be computationally slow. In this paper we develop methods for mapping QTL based on multiple regression which can be applied using any general statistical package. We use the example of mapping in an F2 population and show that these regression methods produce very similar results to those obtained using maximum likelihood. The relative simplicity of the regression methods means that models with more than a single QTL can be explored and we give examples of two linked loci and of two interacting loci. Other models, for example with more than two QTL, with environmental fixed effects, with between family variance or for threshold traits, could be fitted in a similar way. The ease, speed of application and generality of regression methods for flanking marker analyses, and the good estimates they obtain, suggest that they should provide the method of choice for the analysis of QTL mapping data from inbred line crosses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Haley","given":"C.

The meQTL are enriched for functionally relevant characteristics, including shared chromatin state, High-throuhgput chromosome conformation interaction, and association with gene expression, metabolic variation and clinical traits. We use molecular interaction and colocalization analyses to identify multiple nuclear regulatory pathways linking meQTL loci to phenotypic variation, including UBASH3B (body mass index), NFKBIE (rheumatoid arthritis), MGA (blood pressure) and COMMD7 (white cell counts). For rs6511961, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP–seq) validates zinc finger protein (ZNF)333 as the likely trans acting effector protein. Finally, we used interaction analyses to identify population- and lineage-specific meQTL, including rs174548in FADS1, with the strongest effect in CD8+ T cells, thus linking fatty acid metabolism with immune dysregulation and asthma.

  {"id":"he2021","abstract":"Large-scale genomic surveys of crop germplasm are important for understanding the genetic architecture of favorable traits. The genomic basis of geographic differentiation and fiber improvement in cultivated cotton is poorly understood. Here, we analyzed 3,248 tetraploid cotton genomes and confirmed that the extensive chromosome inversions on chromosomes A06 and A08 underlies the geographic differentiation in cultivated Gossypium hirsutum. We further revealed that the haplotypic diversity originated from landraces, which might be essential for understanding adaptative evolution in cultivated cotton. Introgression and association analyses identified new fiber quality-related loci and demonstrated that the introgressed alleles from two diploid cottons had a large effect on fiber quality improvement. These loci provided the potential power to overcome the bottleneck in fiber quality improvement.

  {"id":"he2022","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              Allopolyploidy greatly expands the range of possible regulatory interactions among functionally redundant homoeologous genes. However, connection between the emerging regulatory complexity and expression and phenotypic diversity in polyploid crops remains elusive. Here, we use diverse wheat accessions to map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and evaluate their effects on the population-scale variation in homoeolog expression dosage. The relative contribution of\n              cis\n              - and\n              trans\n              -eQTL to homoeolog expression variation is strongly affected by both selection and demographic events. Though\n              trans\n              -acting effects play major role in expression regulation, the expression dosage of homoeologs is largely influenced by\n              cis\n              -acting variants, which appear to be subjected to selection. The frequency and expression of homoeologous gene alleles showing strong expression dosage bias are predictive of variation in yield-related traits, and have likely been impacted by breeding for increased productivity. Our study highlights the importance of genomic variants affecting homoeolog expression dosage in shaping agronomic phenotypes and points at their potential utility for improving yield in polyploid crops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,1]]},"author":[{"family":"He","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Rutter","given":"William B."},{"family":"Jordan","given":"Katherine W."},{"family":"Ren","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Taagen","given":"Ellie"},{"family":"DeWitt","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Sehgal","given":"Deepmala"},{"family":"Sukumaran","given":"Sivakumar"},{"family":"Dreisigacker","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Halder","given":"Jyotirmoy"},{"family":"Sehgal","given":"Sunish Kumar"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shuyu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jianli"},{"family":"Fritz","given":"Allan"},{"family":"Cook","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Brown-Guedira","given":"Gina"},{"family":"Pumphrey","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Carter","given":"Arron"},{"family":"Sorrells","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Dubcovsky","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Hayden","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Akhunova","given":"Alina"},{"family":"Morrell","given":"Peter L."},{"family":"Szabo","given":"Les"},{"family":"Rouse","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Akhunov","given":"Eduard"}],"citation-key":"he2022","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-022-28453-y","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,12]]},"language":"en","page":"826","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Genomic variants affecting homoeologous gene expression dosage contribute to agronomic trait variation in allopolyploid wheat","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28453-y","volume":"13"},

The biological rationale for this phenomenon is to promote physiological adaptations to the anticipated environment based on early life experience. However, perinatal exposure to adverse environments can also be associated with adult-onset disorders. Multiple environmental stressors induce glucocorticoids, which prompted us to investigate their role in developmental programming. Here, we report that perinatal glucocorticoid exposure had long-term consequences and resulted in diminished CD8 T cell response in adulthood and impaired control of tumor growth and bacterial infection. We found that perinatal glucocorticoid exposure resulted in persistent alteration of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Consequently, the level of the hormone in adults was significantly reduced, resulting in decreased CD8 T cell function. Our study thus demonstrates that perinatal stress can have long-term consequences on CD8 T cell immunity by altering HPA axis activity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Hong","given":"Jun Young"},{"family":"Lim","given":"Jaechul"},{"family":"Carvalho","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Cho","given":"Jen Young"},{"family":"Vaidyanathan","given":"Bharat"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Shuang"},{"family":"Annicelli","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Ip","given":"W.

  {"id":"hormozdiari2016","abstract":"The vast majority of genome-wide association study (GWAS) risk loci fall in non-coding regions of the genome. One possible hypothesis is that these GWAS risk loci alter the individual’s disease risk through their effect on gene expression in different tissues. In order to understand the mechanisms driving a GWAS risk locus, it is helpful to determine which gene is affected in specific tissue types. For example, the relevant gene and tissue could play a role in the disease mechanism if the same variant responsible for a GWAS locus also affects gene expression. Identifying whether or not the same variant is causal in both GWASs and expression quantitative trail locus (eQTL) studies is challenging because of the uncertainty induced by linkage disequilibrium and the fact that some loci harbor multiple causal variants. However, current methods that address this problem assume that each locus contains a single causal variant. In this paper, we present eCAVIAR, a probabilistic method that has several key advantages over existing methods. First, our method can account for more than one causal variant in any given locus. Second, it can leverage summary statistics without accessing the individual genotype data. We use both simulated and real datasets to demonstrate the utility of our method. Using publicly available eQTL data on 45 different tissues, we demonstrate that eCAVIAR can prioritize likely relevant tissues and target genes for a set of glucose- and insulin-related trait loci.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Hormozdiari","given":"Farhad"},{"family":"Bunt","given":"Martijn","non-dropping-particle":"van de"},{"family":"Segrè","given":"Ayellet V."},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Joo","given":"Jong Wha J."},{"family":"Bilow","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Sul","given":"Jae Hoon"},{"family":"Sankararaman","given":"Sriram"},{"family":"Pasaniuc","given":"Bogdan"},{"family":"Eskin","given":"Eleazar"}],"citation-key":"hormozdiari2016","container-title":"The American Journal of Human Genetics","container-title-short":"The American Journal of Human Genetics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.10.003","ISSN":"0002-9297","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1245-1260","PMID":"27866706","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Colocalization of GWAS and eQTL Signals Detects Target Genes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929716304396","volume":"99"},

However, pan-genome analyses are rare for eukaryotes due to the large sizes and higher complexities of their genomes. Here we proposed EUPAN, a eukaryotic pan-genome analysis toolkit, enabling automatic large-scale eukaryotic pan-genome analyses and detection of gene PAVs at a relatively low sequencing depth. In the previous studies, we demonstrated the effectiveness and high accuracy of EUPAN in the pan-genome analysis of 453 rice genomes, in which we also revealed widespread gene PAVs among individual rice genomes.

  {"id":"hu2020","abstract":"Polyploidy is a widespread phenomenon throughout eukaryotes. Due to the coexistence of duplicated genomes, polyploids offer unique challenges for estimating gene expression levels, which is essential for understanding the massive and various forms of transcriptomic responses accompanying polyploidy. Although previous studies have explored the bioinformatics of polyploid transcriptomic profiling, the causes and consequences of inaccurate quantification of transcripts from duplicated gene copies have not been addressed. Using transcriptomic data from the cotton genus (Gossypium) as an example, we present an analytical workflow to evaluate a variety of bioinformatic method choices at different stages of RNA-seq analysis, from homoeolog expression quantification to downstream analysis used to infer key phenomena of polyploid expression evolution. In general, EAGLE-RC and GSNAP-PolyCat outperform other quantification pipelines tested, and their derived expression dataset best represents the expected homoeolog expression and co-expression divergence. The performance of co-expression network analysis was less affected by homoeolog quantification than by network construction methods, where weighted networks outperformed binary networks. By examining the extent and consequences of homoeolog read ambiguity, we illuminate the potential artifacts that may affect our understanding of duplicate gene expression, including an overestimation of homoeolog co-regulation and the incorrect inference of subgenome asymmetry in network topology. Taken together, our work points to a set of reasonable practices that we hope are broadly applicable to the evolutionary exploration of polyploids.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Guanjing"},{"family":"Grover","given":"Corrinne E"},{"family":"Arick","given":"Mark A","suffix":"II"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Meiling"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Daniel G"},{"family":"Wendel","given":"Jonathan F"}],"citation-key":"hu2020","container-title":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Briefings Bioinf.","DOI":"10.1093/bib/bbaa035","ISSN":"1477-4054","issue":"bbaa035","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,27]]},"source":"Silverchair","title":"Homoeologous gene expression and co-expression network analyses and evolutionary inference in allopolyploids","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa035"},
  {"id":"hu2021","abstract":"We present an overview of Gossypium genome evolution and the implications of this understanding for targeted breeding objectives. The cotton genus (Gossypium) contains more than 50 species distributed in arid to semiarid regions of the tropic and subtropics. Following the genus origin approximately 10–15 million years ago, a rapid global radiation leads to eight major genome groups (A through G and K) of diploids (n = 13). Allopolyploid cottons appeared within the last 1–2 million years, as a consequence of transoceanic dispersal of an A-genome taxon to the New World and subsequent hybridization with an indigenous D-genome diploid. The nascent allopolyploid radiated into three modern lineages of seven described species, including the agronomically important species G. hirsutum L. and G. barbadense L. These two allopolyploids, together with two A-genome diploids from Africa-Asia, G. arboreum L. and G. herbaceum L., were independently domesticated for their seed fiber, representing a remarkable case of human-driven parallel evolution. Recent investigations have clarified many aspects of this evolutionary history of Gossypium with genomic insights, including the paleopolyploid history of diploid species, a surprisingly high frequency of natural interspecific hybridization within and among genome groups, myriad interactions of molecular mechanisms underlying allopolyploid genome evolution, and a much-refined evolutionary relationship among gene pools of each of the four cultivated species. The extraordinary natural diversity in Gossypium in fiber morphology, stress tolerance, and other agronomic characteristics provides ample resources for breeders to develop new cotton varieties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Guanjing"},{"family":"Grover","given":"Corrinne E."},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Daojun"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Yating"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Conover","given":"Justin L."},{"family":"Wendel","given":"Jonathan F."}],"citation-key":"hu2021","container-title":"Cotton Precision Breeding","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-64504-5_2","editor":[{"family":"Rahman","given":"Mehboob-ur-"},{"family":"Zafar","given":"Yusuf"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tianzhen"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-64504-5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"25-78","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Evolution and Diversity of the Cotton Genome","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-64504-5_2"},

Analyses of 72 resequenced lychee accessions revealed two independent domestication events. The extremely early maturing cultivars preferentially aligned to one haplotype were domesticated from a wild population in Yunnan, whereas the late-maturing cultivars that mapped mostly to the second haplotype were domesticated independently from a wild population in Hainan. Early maturing cultivars were probably developed in Guangdong via hybridization between extremely early maturing cultivar and late-maturing cultivar individuals. Variable deletions of a 3.7 kb region encompassed by a pair of CONSTANS-like genes probably regulate fruit maturation differences among lychee cultivars. These genomic resources provide insights into the natural history of lychee domestication and will accelerate the improvement of lychee and related crops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Guibing"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Junting"},{"family":"Xiang","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiabao"},{"family":"Salojärvi","given":"Jarkko"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Chengming"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Zhenxian"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jisen"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Xinming"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Zide"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Ou","given":"Liangxi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiawei"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Guangyi"},{"family":"Mai","given":"Yingxiao"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Chengjie"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xingtan"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Jiakun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yanqing"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Hongxiang"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Lixian"},{"family":"Wai","given":"Ching Man"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Xinping"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Jiaxin"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Haibao"},{"family":"Lan","given":"Tianying"},{"family":"Lai","given":"Biao"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Jinhua"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Yongzan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Huanling"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jiezhen"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Xuming"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xin"},{"family":"McHale","given":"Leah K."},{"family":"Rolling","given":"William"},{"family":"Guyot","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Sankoff","given":"David"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Chunfang"},{"family":"Albert","given":"Victor A."},{"family":"Ming","given":"Ray"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Houbin"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jianguo"}],"citation-key":"hu2022","container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00971-3","ISSN":"1546-1718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,3]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Genomics;Plant genetics\nSubject_term_id: genomics;plant-genetics","page":"1-11","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Two divergent haplotypes from a highly heterozygous lychee genome suggest independent domestication events for early and late-maturing cultivars","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00971-3"},
  {"id":"hua2003","abstract":"The genetic basis of heterosis of an elite rice hybrid was investigated by using an “immortalized F2” population produced by randomly permutated intermating of 240 recombinant inbred lines from a cross between the parents of Shanyou 63, the most widely cultivated hybrid in China. Measurements of heterosis for crosses in the immortalized F2 population were obtained from replicated field trials over 2 years by inter-planting the hybrids with the parental recombinant inbred lines. The analyses were conducted making use of a linkage map comprising 231 segregating molecular marker loci covering the entire rice genome. Heterotic effects were detected at 33 loci for the four traits with modified composite interval mapping. The heterotic loci showed little overlap with quantitative trait loci for trait performance, suggesting that heterosis and trait performance may be conditioned by different sets of loci. Large numbers of digenic interactions were resolved by using two-way ANOVA and confirmed by randomization tests. All kinds of genetic effects, including partial-, full-, and overdominance at single-locus level and all three forms of digenic interactions (additive by additive, additive by dominance, and dominance by dominance), contributed to heterosis in the immortalized F2 population, indicating that these genetic components were not mutually exclusive in the genetic basis of heterosis. Heterotic effects at the single-locus level, in combination with the marginal advantages of double heterozygotes caused by dominance by dominance interaction at the two-locus level could adequately explain the genetic basis of heterosis in Shanyou 63. These results may help reconcile the century-long debate concerning the genetic basis of heterosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Hua","given":"Jinping"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Yongzhong"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Weiren"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Caiguo"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Xinli"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Sibin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qifa"}],"citation-key":"hua2003","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.0437907100","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,3,4]]},"language":"en","page":"2574-2579","PMID":"12604771","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Single-locus heterotic effects and dominance by dominance interactions can adequately explain the genetic basis of heterosis in an elite rice hybrid","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/100/5/2574","volume":"100"},

In the search for signatures of selection, we identify 55 selective sweeps that have occurred during domestication. In-depth analyses of the domestication sweeps and genome-wide patterns reveal that Oryza sativa japonica rice was first domesticated from a specific population of O. rufipogon around the middle area of the Pearl River in southern China, and that Oryza sativa indica rice was subsequently developed from crosses between japonica rice and local wild rice as the initial cultivars spread into South East and South Asia.

  {"id":"huang2016","abstract":"Increasing grain yield is a long-term goal in crop breeding to meet the demand for global food security. Heterosis, when a hybrid shows higher performance for a trait than both parents, offers an important strategy for crop breeding. To examine the genetic basis of heterosis for yield in rice, here we generate, sequence and record the phenotypes of 10,074 F2 lines from 17 representative hybrid rice crosses. We classify modern hybrid rice varieties into three groups, representing different hybrid breeding systems. Although we do not find any heterosis-associated loci shared across all lines, within each group, a small number of genomic loci from female parents explain a large proportion of the yield advantage of hybrids over their male parents. For some of these loci, we find support for partial dominance of heterozygous locus for yield-related traits and better-parent heterosis for overall performance when all of the grain-yield traits are considered together. These results inform on the genomic architecture of heterosis and rice hybrid breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Xuehui"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Shihua"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Junyi"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Qilin"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenjun"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Benyi"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Junhui"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Neng"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Danlin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jiaying"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Congcong"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Yiqi"},{"family":"Weng","given":"Qijun"},{"family":"Han","given":"Bin"}],"citation-key":"huang2016","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature19760","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7622","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Genome informatics;Natural variation in plants;Plant genetics\nSubject_term_id: genome-informatics;natural-variation-in-plants;plant-genetics","number":"7622","page":"629-633","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Genomic architecture of heterosis for yield traits in rice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19760","volume":"537"},
  {"id":"huang2017","abstract":"Gossypium hirsutum L. represents the largest source of textile fibre, and China is one of the largest cotton-producing and cotton-consuming countries in the world. To investigate the genetic architecture of the agronomic traits of upland cotton in China, a diverse and nationwide population containing 503 G. hirsutum accessions was collected for a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 16 agronomic traits. The accessions were planted in four places from 2012 to 2013 for phenotyping. The CottonSNP63K array and a published high-density map based on this array were used for genotyping. The 503 G. hirsutum accessions were divided into three subpopulations based on 11 975 quantified polymorphic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). By comparing the genetic structure and phenotypic variation among three genetic subpopulations, seven geographic distributions and four breeding periods, we found that geographic distribution and breeding period were not the determinants of genetic structure. In addition, no obvious phenotypic differentiations were found among the three subpopulations, even though they had different genetic backgrounds. A total of 324 SNPs and 160 candidate quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions were identified as significantly associated with the 16 agronomic traits. A network was established for multieffects in QTLs and interassociations among traits. Thirty-eight associated regions had pleiotropic effects controlling more than one trait. One candidate gene, Gh_D08G2376, was speculated to control the lint percentage (LP). This GWAS is the first report using high-resolution SNPs in upland cotton in China to comprehensively investigate agronomic traits, and it provides a fundamental resource for cotton genetic research and breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Nie","given":"Xinhui"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Chao"},{"family":"You","given":"Chunyuan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wu"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Wenxia"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xianlong"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Zhongxu"}],"citation-key":"huang2017","container-title":"Plant Biotechnology Journal","DOI":"10.1111/pbi.12722","ISSN":"1467-7652","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/pbi.12722","page":"1374-1386","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Population structure and genetic basis of the agronomic traits of upland cotton in China revealed by a genome-wide association study using high-density SNPs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pbi.12722","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"huang2021","abstract":"Cotton is not only the world's most important natural fiber crop, but it is also an ideal system in which to study genome evolution, polyploidization, and cell elongation. With the assembly of five different cotton genomes, a cotton-specific whole-genome duplication with an allopolyploidization process that combined the A- and D-genomes became evident. All existing A-genomes seemed to originate from the A0-genome as a common ancestor, and several transposable element bursts contributed to A-genome size expansion and speciation. The ethylene production pathway is shown to regulate fiber elongation. A tip-biased diffuse growth mode and several regulatory mechanisms, including plant hormones, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifications, are involved in fiber development. Finally, we describe the involvement of the gossypol biosynthetic pathway in the manipulation of herbivorous insects, the role of GoPGF in gland formation, and host-induced gene silencing for pest and disease control. These new genes, modules, and pathways will accelerate the genetic improvement of cotton. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Plant Biology, Volume 72 is May 2021.

As maize spread across the world, selection for local environments resulted in variation, but the impact on differences between the genome has not been quantified. By producing high-quality genomic sequences of the 26 lines used in the maize nested association mapping panel, Hufford et al. map important traits and demonstrate the diversity of maize. Examining RNA and methylation of genes across accessions, the authors identified a core set of maize genes. Beyond this core set, comparative analysis across lines identified high levels of variation in the total set of genes, the maize pan-genome. The value of this resource was further exemplified by mapping quantitative traits of interest, including those related to pathogen resistance.\nScience, abg5289, this issue p. 655\nWe report de novo genome assemblies, transcriptomes, annotations, and methylomes for the 26 inbreds that serve as the founders for the maize nested association mapping population.

The results demonstrate that the ancient tetraploid character of maize continues to degrade by fractionation to the present day. Excellent contiguity over repeat arrays and complete annotation of centromeres revealed additional variation in major cytological landmarks. We show that combining structural variation with single-nucleotide polymorphisms can improve the power of quantitative mapping studies.

Outlook 918 Acknowledgements 919 References 919 Summary Association mapping is rapidly becoming the main method for dissecting the genetic architecture of complex traits in plants. Currently most association mapping studies in plants are preformed using sets of genes selected to be putative candidates for the trait of interest, but rapid developments in genomics will allow for genome-wide mapping in virtually any plant species in the near future. As the costs for genotyping are decreasing, the focus has shifted towards phenotyping. In plants, clonal replication and/or inbred lines allows for replicated phenotyping under many different environmental conditions. Reduced sequencing costs will increase the number of studies that use RNA sequencing data to perform expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, which will increase our knowledge of how gene expression variation contributes to phenotypic variation. Current population sizes used in association mapping studies are modest in size and need to be greatly increased if mutations explaining less than a few per cent of the phenotypic variation are to be detected. Association mapping has started to yield insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits in plants, and future studies with greater genome coverage will help to elucidate how plants have managed to adapt to a wide variety of environmental conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ingvarsson","given":"Pär K."},{"family":"Street","given":"Nathaniel R."}],"citation-key":"ingvarsson2011","container-title":"New Phytologist","DOI":"10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03593.x","ISSN":"1469-8137","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03593.x","page":"909-922","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Association genetics of complex traits in plants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03593.x","volume":"189"},

Although hypothesized to serve important regulatory functions, physiologic roles of the minor spliceosome are not well understood. For example, the minor spliceosome component ZRSR2 is subject to recurrent, leukemia-associated mutations, yet functional connections among minor introns, hematopoiesis and cancers are unclear. Here, we identify that impaired minor intron excision via ZRSR2 loss enhances hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal. CRISPR screens mimicking nonsense-mediated decay of minor intron-containing mRNA species converged on LZTR1, a regulator of RAS-related GTPases. LZTR1 minor intron retention was also discovered in the RASopathy Noonan syndrome, due to intronic mutations disrupting splicing and diverse solid tumors. These data uncover minor intron recognition as a regulator of hematopoiesis, noncoding mutations within minor introns as potential cancer drivers and links among ZRSR2 mutations, LZTR1 regulation and leukemias.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Inoue","given":"Daichi"},{"family":"Polaski","given":"Jacob T."},{"family":"Taylor","given":"Justin"},{"family":"Castel","given":"Pau"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Sisi"},{"family":"Kobayashi","given":"Susumu"},{"family":"Hogg","given":"Simon J."},{"family":"Hayashi","given":"Yasutaka"},{"family":"Pineda","given":"Jose Mario Bello"},{"family":"El Marabti","given":"Ettaib"},{"family":"Erickson","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Knorr","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Fukumoto","given":"Miki"},{"family":"Yamazaki","given":"Hiromi"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Atsushi"},{"family":"Fukui","given":"Chie"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Sydney X."},{"family":"Durham","given":"Benjamin H."},{"family":"Liu","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Mehta","given":"Sanjoy"},{"family":"Zakheim","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Garippa","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Penson","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Chew","given":"Guo-Liang"},{"family":"McCormick","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Bradley","given":"Robert K."},{"family":"Abdel-Wahab","given":"Omar"}],"citation-key":"inoue2021","container-title":"Nature Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-021-00828-9","ISSN":"1546-1718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,12]]},"language":"en","page":"1-12","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Minor intron retention drives clonal hematopoietic disorders and diverse cancer predisposition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00828-9"},

Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers ∼99% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of ∼1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death.

Single-cell transcriptome analysis1–6, three-dimensional morphological classification7 and electron microscopy mapping of the connectome8,9 have revealed an immense diversity of neuronal and glial cell types that underlie an array of functional and behavioural traits in the fly. The identities of these cell types are controlled by gene regulatory networks (GRNs), involving combinations of transcription factors that bind to genomic enhancers to regulate their target genes. Here, to characterize GRNs at the cell-type level in the fly brain, we profiled the chromatin accessibility of 240,919 single cells spanning 9 developmental timepoints and integrated these data with single-cell transcriptomes. We identify more than 95,000 regulatory regions that are used in different neuronal cell types, of which 70,000 are linked to developmental trajectories involving neurogenesis, reprogramming and maturation. For 40 cell types, uniquely accessible regions were associated with their expressed transcription factors and downstream target genes through a combination of motif discovery, network inference and deep learning, creating enhancer GRNs. The enhancer architectures revealed by DeepFlyBrain lead to a better understanding of neuronal regulatory diversity and can be used to design genetic driver lines for cell types at specific timepoints, facilitating their characterization and manipulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Janssens","given":"Jasper"},{"family":"Aibar","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Taskiran","given":"Ibrahim Ihsan"},{"family":"Ismail","given":"Joy N."},{"family":"Gomez","given":"Alicia Estacio"},{"family":"Aughey","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Spanier","given":"Katina I."},{"family":"De Rop","given":"Florian V."},{"family":"González-Blas","given":"Carmen Bravo"},{"family":"Dionne","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Grimes","given":"Krista"},{"family":"Quan","given":"Xiao Jiang"},{"family":"Papasokrati","given":"Dafni"},{"family":"Hulselmans","given":"Gert"},{"family":"Makhzami","given":"Samira"},{"family":"De Waegeneer","given":"Maxime"},{"family":"Christiaens","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Southall","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Aerts","given":"Stein"}],"citation-key":"janssens2022","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-04262-z","ISSN":"1476-4687","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Cellular neuroscience;Developmental neurogenesis;Gene regulation;Gene regulatory networks\nSubject_term_id: cellular-neuroscience;developmental-neurogenesis;gene-regulation;gene-regulatory-networks","page":"1-7","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Decoding gene regulation in the fly brain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04262-z"},
  {"id":"jay2021","abstract":"Chromosomal inversions are ubiquitous in genomes and often coordinate complex phenotypes, such as the covariation of behavior and morphology in many birds, fishes, insects or mammals1–11. However, why and how inversions become associated with polymorphic traits remains obscure. Here we show that despite a strong selective advantage when they form, inversions accumulate recessive deleterious mutations that generate frequency-dependent selection and promote their maintenance at intermediate frequency. Combining genomics and in vivo fitness analyses in a model butterfly for wing-pattern polymorphism, Heliconius numata, we reveal that three ecologically advantageous inversions have built up a heavy mutational load from the sequential accumulation of deleterious mutations and transposable elements. Inversions associate with sharply reduced viability when homozygous, which prevents them from replacing ancestral chromosome arrangements. Our results suggest that other complex polymorphisms, rather than representing adaptations to competing ecological optima, could evolve because chromosomal rearrangements are intrinsically prone to carrying recessive harmful mutations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Jay","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Chouteau","given":"Mathieu"},{"family":"Whibley","given":"Annabel"},{"family":"Bastide","given":"Héloïse"},{"family":"Parrinello","given":"Hugues"},{"family":"Llaurens","given":"Violaine"},{"family":"Joron","given":"Mathieu"}],"citation-key":"jay2021","container-title":"Nature Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-020-00771-1","ISSN":"1546-1718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,25]]},"language":"en","page":"1-6","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Mutation load at a mimicry supergene sheds new light on the evolution of inversion polymorphisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-00771-1"},

Owing to pervasive genomic structural variation, a single reference genome assembly cannot capture the full complement of sequence diversity of a crop species (known as the ‘pan-genome’1). Multiple high-quality sequence assemblies are an indispensable component of a pan-genome infrastructure. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is an important cereal crop with a long history of cultivation that is adapted to a wide range of agro-climatic conditions2. Here we report the construction of chromosome-scale sequence assemblies for the genotypes of 20 varieties of barley—comprising landraces, cultivars and a wild barley—that were selected as representatives of global barley diversity. We catalogued genomic presence/absence variants and explored the use of structural variants for quantitative genetic analysis through whole-genome shotgun sequencing of 300 gene bank accessions. We discovered abundant large inversion polymorphisms and analysed in detail two inversions that are frequently found in current elite barley germplasm; one is probably the product of mutation breeding and the other is tightly linked to a locus that is involved in the expansion of geographical range. This first-generation barley pan-genome makes previously hidden genetic variation accessible to genetic studies and breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Jayakodi","given":"Murukarthick"},{"family":"Padmarasu","given":"Sudharsan"},{"family":"Haberer","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Bonthala","given":"Venkata Suresh"},{"family":"Gundlach","given":"Heidrun"},{"family":"Monat","given":"Cécile"},{"family":"Lux","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Kamal","given":"Nadia"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Himmelbach","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Ens","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiao-Qi"},{"family":"Angessa","given":"Tefera T."},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Gaofeng"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Camilla"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Penghao"},{"family":"Schreiber","given":"Miriam"},{"family":"Boston","given":"Lori B."},{"family":"Plott","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Jerry"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Fiebig","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Budak","given":"Hikmet"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Dongdong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chunchao"},{"family":"Grimwood","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Schmutz","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Ganggang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guoping"},{"family":"Mochida","given":"Keiichi"},{"family":"Hirayama","given":"Takashi"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Kazuhiro"},{"family":"Chalmers","given":"Kenneth J."},{"family":"Langridge","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Waugh","given":"Robbie"},{"family":"Pozniak","given":"Curtis J."},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Klaus F.

  {"id":"jia2014","abstract":"Improving yield is a major objective for cotton breeding schemes, and lint yield and its three component traits (boll number, boll weight and lint percentage) are complex traits controlled by multiple genes and various environments. Association mapping was performed to detect markers associated with these four traits using 651 simple sequence repeats (SSRs). A mixed linear model including epistasis and environmental interaction was used to screen the loci associated with these four yield traits by 323 accessions of Gossypium hirsutum L. evaluated in nine different environments. 251 significant loci were detected to be associated with lint yield and its three components, including 69 loci with individual effects and all involved in epistasis interactions. These significant loci explain ∼ 62.05% of the phenotypic variance (ranging from 49.06% ∼ 72.29% for these four traits). It was indicated by high contribution of environmental interaction to the phenotypic variance for lint yield and boll numbers, that genetic effects of SSR loci were susceptible to environment factors. Shared loci were also observed among these four traits, which may be used for simultaneous improvement in cotton breeding for yield traits. Furthermore, consistent and elite loci were screened with −Log10 (P-value) >8.0 based on predicted effects of loci detected in different environments. There was one locus and 6 pairs of epistasis for lint yield, 4 loci and 10 epistasis for boll number, 15 loci and 2 epistasis for boll weight, and 2 loci and 5 epistasis for lint percentage, respectively. These results provided insights into the genetic basis of lint yield and its components and may be useful for marker-assisted breeding to improve cotton production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Jia","given":"Yinhua"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Xiwei"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Junling"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Zhaoe"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiwen"},{"family":"He","given":"Shoupu"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Songhua"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Weijun"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Zhongli"},{"family":"Pang","given":"Baoyin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Liru"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jianguang"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Du","given":"Xiongming"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jun"}],"citation-key":"jia2014","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0095882","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,5,8]]},"language":"en","page":"e95882","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Association Mapping for Epistasis and Environmental Interaction of Yield Traits in 323 Cotton Cultivars under 9 Different Environments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0095882","volume":"9"},

Target recognition strictly requires the presence of a short protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) flanking the target site, and subsequent R-loop formation and strand scission are driven by complementary base pairing between the guide RNA and target DNA, Cas9–DNA interactions, and associated conformational changes. The use of CRISPR–Cas9 as an RNA-programmable DNA targeting and editing platform is simplified by a synthetic single-guide RNA (sgRNA) mimicking the natural dual trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA)–CRISPR RNA (crRNA) structure. This review aims to provide an in-depth mechanistic and structural understanding of Cas9-mediated RNA-guided DNA targeting and cleavage. Molecular insights from biochemical and structural studies provide a framework for rational engineering aimed at altering catalytic function, guide RNA specificity, and PAM requirements and reducing off-target activity for the development of Cas9-based therapies against genetic diseases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Fuguo"},{"family":"Doudna","given":"Jennifer A."}],"citation-key":"jiang2017a","container-title":"Annual Review of Biophysics","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-biophys-062215-010822","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-062215-010822","page":"505-529","PMID":"28375731","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"CRISPR–Cas9 Structures and Mechanisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biophys-062215-010822","volume":"46"},

Here, insights are provided through our report of the genome sequence of the unicellular alga Penium margaritaceum, a member of the Zygnematophyceae, the sister lineage to land plants. The genome has a high proportion of repeat sequences that are associated with massive segmental gene duplications, likely facilitating neofunctionalization. Compared with representatives of earlier diverging algal lineages, P. margaritaceum has expanded repertoires of gene families, signaling networks, and adaptive responses that highlight the evolutionary trajectory toward terrestrialization. These encompass a broad range of physiological processes and protective cellular features, such as flavonoid compounds and large families of modifying enzymes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, assembly, and remodeling. Transcriptome profiling further elucidated adaptations, responses, and selective pressures associated with the semi-terrestrial ecosystems of P. margaritaceum, where a simple body plan would be an advantage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiao","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Sørensen","given":"Iben"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Xuepeng"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Honghe"},{"family":"Behar","given":"Hila"},{"family":"Alseekh","given":"Saleh"},{"family":"Philippe","given":"Glenn"},{"family":"Palacio Lopez","given":"Kattia"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Li"},{"family":"Reed","given":"Reagan"},{"family":"Jeon","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Kiyonami","given":"Reiko"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Fernie","given":"Alisdair R."},{"family":"Brumer","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Domozych","given":"David S."},{"family":"Fei","given":"Zhangjun"},{"family":"Rose","given":"Jocelyn K.

Many provided supplemental and helpful perspectives on concepts we addressed.

In this response, we thus emphasize that we do not claim that specific kinds of complexity, or, even worse, intractable complexity, pervade the genetics of behavioural traits. Rather, our claim is that genetics is riddled with complexity of many degrees and kinds, and heritability is a poor indicator of either degree or kind of underlying genetic complexity.

  {"id":"kammonen2019","abstract":"Unknown sequences, or gaps, are present in many published genomes across public databases. Gap filling is an important finishing step in de novo genome assembly, especially in large genomes. The gap filling problem is nontrivial and while there are many computational tools partially solving the problem, several have shortcomings as to the reliability and correctness of the output, i.e. the gap filled draft genome. SSPACE-LongRead is a scaffolding tool that utilizes long reads from multiple third-generation sequencing platforms in finding links between contigs and combining them. The long reads potentially contain sequence information to fill the gaps created in the scaffolding, but SSPACE-LongRead currently lacks this functionality. We present an automated pipeline called gapFinisher to process SSPACE-LongRead output to fill gaps after the scaffolding. gapFinisher is based on the controlled use of a previously published gap filling tool FGAP and works on all standard Linux/UNIX command lines. We compare the performance of gapFinisher against two other published gap filling tools PBJelly and GMcloser. We conclude that gapFinisher can fill gaps in draft genomes quickly and reliably. In addition, the serial design of gapFinisher makes it scale well from prokaryote genomes to larger genomes with no increase in the computational footprint.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kammonen","given":"Juhana I."},{"family":"Smolander","given":"Olli-Pekka"},{"family":"Paulin","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Pereira","given":"Pedro A.

However, the process by which the acquired immune systems adapts lipid metabolism to meet demands, and whether or not the metabolic rewiring confers a selective advantage to host immunity, remains unclear. Here we show that viral infection attenuates the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism in murine CD4+ T cells, which in turn increases the expression of antiviral genes. Inhibition of the fatty acid synthesis pathway substantially increases the basal expression of antiviral genes via the spontaneous production of type I interferon (IFN). Using a combination of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technology and a global lipidomics analysis, we found that the decrease in monounsaturated fatty acid caused by genetic deletion of Scd2 in mice was crucial for the induction of an antiviral response through activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. These findings demonstrate the important relationship between fatty acid biosynthesis and type I IFN responses that enhances the antiviral response.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kanno","given":"Toshio"},{"family":"Nakajima","given":"Takahiro"},{"family":"Yokoyama","given":"Satoru"},{"family":"Asou","given":"Hikari K."},{"family":"Sasamoto","given":"Shigemi"},{"family":"Kamii","given":"Yasuhiro"},{"family":"Hayashizaki","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Ouchi","given":"Yasuo"},{"family":"Onodera","given":"Taishi"},{"family":"Takahashi","given":"Yoshimasa"},{"family":"Ikeda","given":"Kazutaka"},{"family":"Hasegawa","given":"Yoshinori"},{"family":"Kinjo","given":"Yuki"},{"family":"Ohara","given":"Osamu"},{"family":"Nakayama","given":"Toshinori"},{"family":"Endo","given":"Yusuke"}],"citation-key":"kanno2021","container-title":"Communications Biology","container-title-short":"Commun Biol","DOI":"10.1038/s42003-021-02310-y","ISSN":"2399-3642","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,29]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Antimicrobial responses;Interferons;T-helper 1 cells;Viral host response\nSubject_term_id: antimicrobial-responses;interferons;t-helper-1-cells;viral-host-response","number":"1","page":"1-14","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"SCD2-mediated monounsaturated fatty acid metabolism regulates cGAS-STING-dependent type I IFN responses in CD4+ T cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02310-y","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"kautt2020","abstract":"The transition from ‘well-marked varieties’ of a single species into ‘well-defined species’—especially in the absence of geographic barriers to gene flow (sympatric speciation)—has puzzled evolutionary biologists ever since Darwin1,2. Gene flow counteracts the buildup of genome-wide differentiation, which is a hallmark of speciation and increases the likelihood of the evolution of irreversible reproductive barriers (incompatibilities) that complete the speciation process3. Theory predicts that the genetic architecture of divergently selected traits can influence whether sympatric speciation occurs4, but empirical tests of this theory are scant because comprehensive data are difficult to collect and synthesize across species, owing to their unique biologies and evolutionary histories5. Here, within a young species complex of neotropical cichlid fishes (Amphilophus spp.), we analysed genomic divergence among populations and species. By generating a new genome assembly and re-sequencing 453 genomes, we uncovered the genetic architecture of traits that have been suggested to be important for divergence. Species that differ in monogenic or oligogenic traits that affect ecological performance and/or mate choice show remarkably localized genomic differentiation. By contrast, differentiation among species that have diverged in polygenic traits is genomically widespread and much higher overall, consistent with the evolution of effective and stable genome-wide barriers to gene flow. Thus, we conclude that simple trait architectures are not always as conducive to speciation with gene flow as previously suggested, whereas polygenic architectures can promote rapid and stable speciation in sympatry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Kautt","given":"Andreas F."},{"family":"Kratochwil","given":"Claudius F."},{"family":"Nater","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Machado-Schiaffino","given":"Gonzalo"},{"family":"Olave","given":"Melisa"},{"family":"Henning","given":"Frederico"},{"family":"Torres-Dowdall","given":"Julián"},{"family":"Härer","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Hulsey","given":"C.

  {"id":"kemper2012","abstract":"The genetic architecture of complex traits in cattle includes very large numbers of loci affecting any given trait. Most of these loci have small effects but occasionally there are loci with moderate-to-large effects segregating due to recent selection for the mutant allele. Genomic markers capture most but not all of the additive genetic variance for traits, probably because there are causal mutations with low allele frequency and therefore in incomplete linkage disequilibrium with the markers. The prediction of genetic value from genomic markers can achieve high accuracy by using statistical models that include all markers and assuming that marker effects are random variables drawn from a specified prior distribution. Recent effective population size is in the order of 100 within cattle breeds and ∼2500 animals with genotypes and phenotypes are sufficient to predict the genetic value of animals with an accuracy of 0.65. Recent effective population size for humans is much larger, in the order of 10 000–15 000, and more than 145 000 records would be required to reach a similar accuracy for people. However, our calculations assume that genomic markers capture all the genetic variance.

Moreover, the temporal nature of stress responses adds another layer of complexity wherein sets of genes are regulated differently based on their timing of expression during stress response. Understanding the complex cis-regulatory syntax is essential to predict when and where genes are expressed and how sequence variations lead to downstream changes in gene expression. Recent advances in deep-learning approaches have enabled predictions of gene expression from genomic DNA features (Wang et al., 2020; Meng et al., 2021). Previous studies have established the ability of computational models to predict plant spatial transcriptional response using known and novel CREs (Uygun et al., 2017). However, a global model to uncover regulatory elements affecting temporal responses to environmental stimuli is still lacking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kenchanmane Raju","given":"Sunil Kumar"}],"citation-key":"kenchanmaneraju2022","container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"The Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1093/plcell/koab288","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"page":"716-717","source":"Silverchair","title":"Machine learning models reveal the importance of time-point specific cis-regulatory elements in Arabidopsis thaliana wounding response","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/plcell/koab288","volume":"34"},

Consequently, target genes for most genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals have still not been identified. In the present study, we present the eQTL Catalogue (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl), a resource of quality-controlled, uniformly re-computed gene expression and splicing QTLs from 21 studies. We find that, for matching cell types and tissues, the eQTL effect sizes are highly reproducible between studies. Although most QTLs were shared between most bulk tissues, we identified a greater diversity of cell-type-specific QTLs from purified cell types, a subset of which also manifested as new disease co-localizations.

Here we describe the results of genome-wide expression variation analysis in an RIL population of Arabidopsis thaliana. For many genes, variation in expression could be explained by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The nature and consequences of this variation are discussed based on additional genetic parameters, such as heritability and transgression and by examining the genomic position of eQTLs versus gene position, polymorphism frequency, and gene ontology. Furthermore, we developed an approach for genetic regulatory network construction by combining eQTL mapping and regulator candidate gene selection. The power of our method was shown in a case study of genes associated with flowering time, a well studied regulatory network in Arabidopsis. Results that revealed clusters of coregulated genes and their most likely regulators were in agreement with published data, and unknown relationships could be predicted.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Keurentjes","given":"Joost J.

  {"id":"khanday2019","abstract":"The molecular pathways that trigger the initiation of embryogenesis after fertilization in flowering plants, and prevent its occurrence without fertilization, are not well understood1. Here we show in rice (Oryza sativa) that BABY BOOM1 (BBM1), a member of the AP2 family2 of transcription factors that is expressed in sperm cells, has a key role in this process. Ectopic expression of BBM1 in the egg cell is sufficient for parthenogenesis, which indicates that a single wild-type gene can bypass the fertilization checkpoint in the female gamete. Zygotic expression of BBM1 is initially specific to the male allele but is subsequently biparental, and this is consistent with its observed auto-activation. Triple knockout of the genes BBM1, BBM2 and BBM3 causes embryo arrest and abortion, which are fully rescued by male-transmitted BBM1. These findings suggest that the requirement for fertilization in embryogenesis is mediated by male-genome transmission of pluripotency factors. When genome editing to substitute mitosis for meiosis (MiMe)3,4 is combined with the expression of BBM1 in the egg cell, clonal progeny can be obtained that retain genome-wide parental heterozygosity. The synthetic asexual-propagation trait is heritable through multiple generations of clones. Hybrid crops provide increased yields that cannot be maintained by their progeny owing to genetic segregation. This work establishes the feasibility of asexual reproduction in crops, and could enable the maintenance of hybrids clonally through seed propagation5,6.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Khanday","given":"Imtiyaz"},{"family":"Skinner","given":"Debra"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Mercier","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"Sundaresan","given":"Venkatesan"}],"citation-key":"khanday2019","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-018-0785-8","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7737","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Plant embryogenesis;Seed development\nSubject_term_id: plant-embryogenesis;seed-development","number":"7737","page":"91-95","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A male-expressed rice embryogenic trigger redirected for asexual propagation through seeds","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0785-8","volume":"565"},

In genomics the development of deep neural networks is expected to revolutionize current practice. Several approaches relying on convolutional neural networks have been developed to associate short genomic sequences with a functional role such as promoters, enhancers or protein binding sites along genomes. These approaches rely on the generation of sequences batches with known annotations for learning purpose. While they show good performance to predict annotations from a test subset of these batches, they usually perform poorly when applied genome-wide.</p><p>In this study, we address this issue and propose an optimal strategy to train convolutional neural networks for this specific application. We use as a case study transcription start sites and show that a model trained on one organism can be used to predict transcription start sites in a different specie. This cross-species application of convolutional neural networks trained with genomic sequence data provides a new technique to annotate any genome from previously existing annotations in related species. It also provides a way to determine whether the sequence patterns recognized by chromatin associated proteins in different species are conserved or not.</p>","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Khodabandelou","given":"Ghazaleh"},{"family":"Routhier","given":"Etienne"},{"family":"Mozziconacci","given":"Julien"}],"citation-key":"khodabandelou2019","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/330308","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,7]]},"language":"en","page":"330308","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","section":"New Results","source":"www.biorxiv.org","title":"Genome Functional Annotation across Species using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/330308v4"},

Big-LD uses an agglomerative approach that starts by identifying small communities of SNPs, i.e. the SNPs in each LD bin region, and proceeds by merging these communities. We determine the number of blocks using a method to find maximum-weight independent set. Big-LD produces larger LD blocks compared to existing methods such as MATILDE, Haploview, MIG ++, or S-MIG ++ and the LD blocks better agree with recombination hotspot locations determined by sperm-typing experiments. The observed average runtime of Big-LD for 13 288 240 non-monomorphic SNPs from 1000 Genomes Project autosome data (286 East Asians) is about 5.83 h, which is a significant improvement over the existing methods.Source code and documentation are available for download at http://github.com/sunnyeesl/BigLD.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Sun Ah"},{"family":"Cho","given":"Chang-Sung"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Suh-Ryung"},{"family":"Bull","given":"Shelley B"},{"family":"Yoo","given":"Yun Joo"}],"citation-key":"kim2018","container-title":"Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btx609","ISSN":"1367-4803","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,2,1]]},"page":"388-397","source":"Silverchair","title":"A new haplotype block detection method for dense genome sequencing data based on interval graph modeling of clusters of highly correlated SNPs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx609","volume":"34"},

DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous discontinuous transcription events. In addition to the canonical genomic and 9 subgenomic RNAs, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further ﬁnd at least 41 RNA modiﬁcation sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif, AAGAA. Modiﬁed RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodiﬁed RNAs, suggesting a link between the modiﬁcation and the 30 tail.

  {"id":"kumasaka2019","abstract":"Physical interaction of regulatory elements in three-dimensional space poses a challenge for studies of disease because non-coding risk variants may be great distances from the genes they regulate. Experimental methods to capture these interactions, such as chromosome conformation capture, usually cannot assign causal direction of effect between regulatory elements, an important component of fine-mapping studies. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical approach that uses two-stage least squares and applied it to an ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing) data set from 100 individuals, to identify over 15,000 high-confidence causal interactions. Most (60%) interactions occurred over <20 kb, where chromosome conformation capture-based methods perform poorly. For a fraction of loci, we identified a single variant that alters accessibility across multiple regions, and experimentally validated the BLK locus, which is associated with multiple autoimmune diseases, using CRISPR genome editing. Our study highlights how association genetics of chromatin state is a powerful approach for identifying interactions between regulatory elements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Kumasaka","given":"Natsuhiko"},{"family":"Knights","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Gaffney","given":"Daniel J."}],"citation-key":"kumasaka2019","container-title":"Nature Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-018-0278-6","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"128-137","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"High-resolution genetic mapping of putative causal interactions between regions of open chromatin","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0278-6","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"lamberto2010","abstract":"S-allantoin, a major ureide compound, is produced in plant peroxisomes from oxidized purines. Sequence evidence suggested that the Transthyretin-like (TTL) protein, which interacts with brassinosteroid receptors, may act as a bifunctional enzyme in the synthesis of S-allantoin. Here, we show that recombinant TTL from Arabidopsis thaliana catalyzes two enzymatic reactions leading to the stereoselective formation of S-allantoin, hydrolysis of hydroxyisourate through a C-terminal Urah domain, and decarboxylation of 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline through an N-terminal Urad domain. We found that two different mRNAs are produced from the TTL gene through alternative use of two splice acceptor sites. The corresponding proteins differ in the presence (TTL1−) and the absence (TTL2−) of a rare internal peroxisomal targeting signal (PTS2). The two proteins have similar catalytic activity in vitro but different in vivo localization: TTL1− localizes in peroxisomes, whereas TTL2− localizes in the cytosol. Similar splice variants are present in monocots and dicots. TTL originated in green algae through a Urad-Urah fusion, which entrapped an N-terminal PTS2 between the two domains. The presence of this gene in all Viridiplantae indicates that S-allantoin biosynthesis has general significance in plant nitrogen metabolism, while conservation of alternative splicing suggests that this mechanism has general implications in the regulation of the ureide pathway in flowering plants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Lamberto","given":"Ilaria"},{"family":"Percudani","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Gatti","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Folli","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Petrucco","given":"Stefania"}],"citation-key":"lamberto2010","container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"The Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1105/tpc.109.070102","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,5,1]]},"page":"1564-1574","source":"Silverchair","title":"Conserved Alternative Splicing of Arabidopsis Transthyretin-Like Determines Protein Localization and S-Allantoin Synthesis in Peroxisomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.109.070102","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"li2007","abstract":"Composite interval mapping (CIM) is the most commonly used method for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) with populations derived from biparental crosses. However, the algorithm implemented in the popular QTL Cartographer software may not completely ensure all its advantageous properties. In addition, different background marker selection methods may give very different mapping results, and the nature of the preferred method is not clear. A modiﬁed algorithm called inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) is proposed in this article. In ICIM, marker selection is conducted only once through stepwise regression by considering all marker information simultaneously, and the phenotypic values are then adjusted by all markers retained in the regression equation except the two markers ﬂanking the current mapping interval. The adjusted phenotypic values are ﬁnally used in interval mapping (IM). The modiﬁed algorithm has a simpler form than that used in CIM, but a faster convergence speed. ICIM retains all advantages of CIM over IM and avoids the possible increase of sampling variance and the complicated background marker selection process in CIM. Extensive simulations using two genomes and various genetic models indicated that ICIM has increased detection power, a reduced false detection rate, and less biased estimates of QTL effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Huihui"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Guoyou"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiankang"}],"citation-key":"li2007","container-title":"Genetics","container-title-short":"Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/genetics.106.066811","ISSN":"0016-6731, 1943-2631","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,1]]},"language":"en","page":"361-374","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Modified Algorithm for the Improvement of Composite Interval Mapping","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/175/1/361-374/6062043","volume":"175"},

  {"id":"li2017","abstract":"Rice feeds half the world’s population, and rice blast is often a destructive disease that results in significant crop loss. Non-race-specific resistance has been more effective in controlling crop diseases than race-specific resistance because of its broad spectrum and durability. Through a genome-wide association study, we report the identification of a natural allele of a C2H2-type transcription factor in rice that confers non-race-specific resistance to blast. A survey of 3,000 sequenced rice genomes reveals that this allele exists in 10% of rice, suggesting that this favorable trait has been selected through breeding. This allele causes a single nucleotide change in the promoter of the bsr-d1 gene, which results in reduced expression of the gene through the binding of the repressive MYB transcription factor and, consequently, an inhibition of H2O2 degradation and enhanced disease resistance. Our discovery highlights this novel allele as a strategy for breeding durable resistance in rice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Weitao"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Ziwei"},{"family":"Chern","given":"Mawsheng"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Junjie"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Ran","given":"Li"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Mengping"},{"family":"He","given":"Min"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Kang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiaogang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xiaobo"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhixiong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jichun"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Wen"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Bingtian"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Weilan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuping"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jiali"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wenming"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xianjun"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jirui"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Lihuang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shigui"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xuewei"}],"citation-key":"li2017","container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2017.06.008","ISSN":"0092-8674","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,29]]},"language":"en","page":"114-126.e15","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A Natural Allele of a Transcription Factor in Rice Confers Broad-Spectrum Blast Resistance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867417306499","volume":"170"},

We find that co-expression of BIA genes increases within clusters and identify candidates with unknown function based on clustering and covariation in expression and alkaloid production. Copy number variation in critical BIA genes correlates with stark differences in alkaloid production, linking noscapine production with an 11-gene deletion, and increased thebaine/decreased morphine production with deletion of a T6ODM cluster.

  {"id":"li2022","abstract":"Disruption of susceptibility (S) genes in crops is an attractive breeding strategy for conferring disease resistance1,2. However, S genes are implicated in many essential biological functions and deletion of these genes typically results in undesired pleiotropic effects1. Loss-of-function mutations in one such S gene, Mildew resistance locus O (MLO), confers durable and broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew in various plant species2,3. However, mlo-associated resistance is also accompanied by growth penalties and yield losses3,4, thereby limiting its widespread use in agriculture. Here we describe Tamlo-R32, a mutant with a 304-kilobase pair targeted deletion in the MLO-B1 locus of wheat that retains crop growth and yields while conferring robust powdery mildew resistance. We show that this deletion results in an altered local chromatin landscape, leading to the ectopic activation of Tonoplast monosaccharide transporter 3 (TaTMT3B), and that this activation alleviates growth and yield penalties associated with MLO disruption. Notably, the function of TMT3 is conserved in other plant species such as Arabidopsis thaliana. Moreover, precision genome editing facilitates the rapid introduction of this mlo resistance allele (Tamlo-R32) into elite wheat varieties. This work demonstrates the ability to stack genetic changes to rescue growth defects caused by recessive alleles, which is critical for developing high-yielding crop varieties with robust and durable disease resistance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Shengnan"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Dexing"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yunwei"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Min"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yongxing"},{"family":"Lv","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Boshu"},{"family":"Lei","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yanpeng"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Long"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yueting"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jinxing"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Kunling"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhiyong"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Jin-Long"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Caixia"}],"citation-key":"li2022","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-022-04395-9","ISSN":"1476-4687","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"language":"en","page":"1-6","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Genome-edited powdery mildew resistance in wheat without growth penalties","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04395-9"},

This study aimed to construct a high-density SNP genetic map and to map QTLs for important yield and fiber quality traits. Using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population and genome resequencing technology, we constructed a high-density genetic map that covered 1980.17 cM with an average distance of 0.61 cM between adjacent markers. QTL analysis revealed a total of 297 QTLs for 13 yield and fiber quality traits in three environments, explaining 5.0-37.4% of the phenotypic variance, among which 75 were stably detected in two or three environments. Besides, 47 QTL clusters, comprising 131 QTLs for representative traits, were identified.

  {"id":"li2022b","abstract":"Although genome-wide association studies are widely used in mining genes for quantitative traits, effects to be estimated are confounded and methodologies of detecting interactions are imperfect. To address these issues, first, the mixed model proposed here estimates the genotypic effects for AA, Aa, and aa, while the genotypic polygenic background replaces additive and dominance polygenic backgrounds. Then, the estimated genotypic effects are partitioned into additive and dominance effects using one-way analysis-of-variance model. This strategy was further expanded to cover QTN-by-environment interaction (QEI) and QTN-by-QTN interaction (QQI) using the same mixed model framework. Thus, a three variance components mixed model was integrated with our mrMLM method to establish a new methodological framework that detects all types of loci and estimates their effects, namely 3VmrMLM. In Monte Carlo studies, 3VmrMLM correctly detected all types of loci and almost unbiasedly estimated their effects, with high powers and accuracies and low false positive rate. In the re-analyses of ten traits in 1439 rice hybrids, 269 known genes, 45 known gene-by-environment interactions and 20 known gene-by-gene interactions strongly validated 3VmrMLM. Further analyses of known genes showed more small (67.49%), minor allele frequency (35.52%), and pleiotropic (30.54%) genes, with higher repeatability across datasets (54.36%), and more dominance loci. In addition, heteroscedasticity mixed model in multiple environments and dimension reduction methods in quite a number of environments were developed to detect QEI, and variable selection under polygenic background was proposed in QQI detection.

The improvement of crop productivity has been ongoing for almost 10,000 years and has evolved from an experience-based to a knowledge-driven practice over the past three decades. Natural alleles and their reshuffling are longstanding genetic changes that affect how crops respond to various environmental conditions and agricultural practices. Decoding the genetic basis of natural variation is central to understanding crop evolution and, in turn, improving crop breeding. Here, we review current advances in the approaches used to map the causal alleles of natural variation, provide refined insights into the genetics and evolution of natural variation, and outline how this knowledge promises to drive the development of sustainable agriculture under the dome of emerging technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Liang","given":"Yameng"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Hai-Jun"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jianbing"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Feng"}],"citation-key":"liang2021","container-title":"Annual Review of Plant Biology","container-title-short":"Annu Rev Plant Biol","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-arplant-080720-090632","ISSN":"1543-5008, 1545-2123","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,20]]},"language":"en","page":"annurev-arplant-080720-090632","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Natural Variation in Crops: Realized Understanding, Continuing Promise","title-short":"Natural Variation in Crops","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-arplant-080720-090632","volume":"72"},

  {"id":"libbrecht2015","abstract":"The field of machine learning includes the development and application of computer algorithms that improve with experience.Machine learning methods can be divided into supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods are trained on examples with labels (for example, 'gene' or 'not gene') and are then used to predict these labels on other examples, whereas unsupervised methods find patterns in data sets without the use of labels. Semi-supervised methods combine these two approaches, leveraging patterns in unlabelled data to improve power in the prediction of labels.Different machine learning methods may be required for an application, depending on whether one is interested in interpreting the output model or is simply concerned with predictive power. Generative models, which posit a probabilistic distribution over input data, are generally best for interpretability, whereas discriminative models, which seek only to model labels, are generally best for predictive power.Prior information can be added to a model in order to train the model more effectively when it is provided with limited data, to limit the complexity of the model or to incorporate data that are not used by the model directly. Prior information can be incorporated explicitly in a probabilistic model or implicitly through the choice of features or similarity measures.The choice of an appropriate performance measure depends strongly on the application task. Machine learning methods are most effective when they optimize an appropriate performance measure.Network estimation methods are appropriate when the data contain complex dependencies among examples. These methods work best when they take into account the confounding effects of indirect relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Libbrecht","given":"Maxwell W."},{"family":"Noble","given":"William Stafford"}],"citation-key":"libbrecht2015","container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/nrg3920","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,6]]},"language":"en","number":"6","page":"321-332","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Machine learning applications in genetics and genomics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3920","volume":"16"},

Inferences about this period are challenging to make because demographic shifts in the past 5,000 years have obscured the structures of more ancient populations3,5. Here we present genome-wide ancient DNA data for six individuals from eastern and south-central Africa spanning the past approximately 18,000 years (doubling the time depth of sub-Saharan African ancient DNA), increase the data quality for 15 previously published ancient individuals and analyse these alongside data from 13 other published ancient individuals. The ancestry of the individuals in our study area can be modelled as a geographically structured mixture of three highly divergent source populations, probably reflecting Pleistocene interactions around 80–20 thousand years ago, including deeply diverged eastern and southern African lineages, plus a previously unappreciated ubiquitous distribution of ancestry that occurs in highest proportion today in central African rainforest hunter-gatherers. Once established, this structure remained highly stable, with limited long-range gene flow. These results provide a new line of genetic evidence in support of hypotheses that have emerged from archaeological analyses but remain contested, suggesting increasing regionalization at the end of the Pleistocene epoch.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Lipson","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Sawchuk","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Jessica C."},{"family":"Oppenheimer","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Tryon","given":"Christian A."},{"family":"Ranhorn","given":"Kathryn L."},{"family":"Luna","given":"Kathryn M.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Sirak","given":"Kendra A."},{"family":"Olalde","given":"Iñigo"},{"family":"Ambrose","given":"Stanley H."},{"family":"Arthur","given":"John W."},{"family":"Arthur","given":"Kathryn J.

  {"id":"lisch2013","abstract":"Transposable elements (TEs) are the single most variable components of plant genomes. Even closely related plants can harbour widely different populations of TEs.TEs can cause a broad array of changes in gene composition and function. These changes range from simple insertional mutations to genetic reprogramming, gene movement and the evolution of novel functional protein-coding sequences.To restrain TE activity, plants have a potent response that results in epigenetic silencing of these elements. This can in turn result in epigenetic as well as genetic variation in plant gene function.The changes caused by TEs are a potentially rich source of variation on which selection can operate. Given the large numbers of plant TEs on evidence for ongoing activity of these selfish genetic elements, it is a reasonable hypothesis that TEs have played an important part in plant adaptation.Despite the possibilities raised by experimental evidence of the kinds of changes that TEs can cause, there is only limited and anecdotal evidence that TEs have in fact been important players in adaptive evolution of plants.Recent advances in genomics and phenomics have made it possible systematically to assess the part that TEs have played. It is only through the systematic identification of large numbers of alleles with important effects on phenotype that it will be possible to determine the relative role that TEs have had in the generation of meaningful genetic variation in plants.Domesticated plant species provide us with an ideal model for understanding this process. These species have been under strong, recent directional selection, often have well-characterized TEs, have been extensively characterized with respect to trait variation and can be readily compared to wild relatives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Lisch","given":"Damon"}],"citation-key":"lisch2013","container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/nrg3374","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,1]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"49-61","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"How important are transposons for plant evolution?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3374","volume":"14"},

To completely eliminate the confounding, we divided MLMM into two parts: Fixed Effect Model (FEM) and a Random Effect Model (REM) and use them iteratively. FEM contains testing markers, one at a time, and multiple associated markers as covariates to control false positives. To avoid model over-fitting problem in FEM, the associated markers are estimated in REM by using them to define kinship. The P values of testing markers and the associated markers are unified at each iteration. We named the new method as Fixed and random model Circulating Probability Unification (FarmCPU). Both real and simulated data analyses demonstrated that FarmCPU improves statistical power compared to current methods. Additional benefits include an efficient computing time that is linear to both number of individuals and number of markers. Now, a dataset with half million individuals and half million markers can be analyzed within three days.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaolei"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhiwu"}],"citation-key":"liu2016","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1005767","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"2","issued":{"literal":"2016年2月1日"},"language":"en","page":"e1005767","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Iterative Usage of Fixed and Random Effect Models for Powerful and Efficient Genome-Wide Association Studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005767","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"liu2017","abstract":"A detailed understanding of genetic architecture of mRNA expression by millions of genetic variants is important for studying quantitative trait variation. In this study, we identiﬁed 1.25M SNPs with a minor allele frequency greater than 0.05 by combining reduced genome sequencing (GBS), highdensity array technologies (600K), and previous deep RNA-sequencing data from 368 diverse inbred lines of maize. The balanced allelic frequencies and distributions in a relatively large and diverse natural panel helped to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) associated with more than 18 000 genes (63.4% of tested genes). We found that distant eQTLs were more frequent ($75% of all eQTLs) across the whole genome. Thirteen novel associated loci affecting maize kernel oil concentration were identiﬁed using the new dataset, among which one intergenic locus affected the kernel oil variation by controlling expression of three other known oil-related genes. Altogether, this study provides resources for expanding our understanding of cellular regulatory mechanisms of transcriptome variation and the landscape of functional variants within the maize genome, thereby enhancing the understanding of quantitative variations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Haijun"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Niu","given":"Luyao"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Yingjie"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Lu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaqing"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Minliang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenqiang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jianbing"}],"citation-key":"liu2017","container-title":"Molecular Plant","container-title-short":"Molecular Plant","DOI":"10.1016/j.molp.2016.06.016","ISSN":"16742052","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,3]]},"language":"en","page":"414-426","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Distant eQTLs and Non-coding Sequences Play Critical Roles in Regulating Gene Expression and Quantitative Trait Variation in Maize","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1674205216301290","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"liu2018","abstract":"It is of great importance to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling fiber quality traits and yield components for future marker-assisted selection (MAS) and candidate gene function identifications. In this study, two kinds of traits in 231 F6:8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs), derived from an intraspecific cross between Xinluzao24, a cultivar with elite fiber quality, and Lumianyan28, a cultivar with wide adaptability and high yield potential, were measured in nine environments. This RIL population was genotyped by 122 SSR and 4729 SNP markers, which were also used to construct the genetic map. The map covered 2477.99 cM of hirsutum genome, with an average marker interval of 0.51 cM between adjacent markers. As a result, a total of 134 QTLs for fiber quality traits and 122 QTLs for yield components were detected, with 2.18–24.45 and 1.68–28.27% proportions of the phenotypic variance explained by each QTL, respectively. Among these QTLs, 57 were detected in at least two environments, named stable QTLs. A total of 209 and 139 quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were associated with fiber quality traits and yield components by four multilocus genome-wide association studies methods, respectively. Among these QTNs, 74 were detected by at least two algorithms or in two environments. The candidate genes harbored by 57 stable QTLs were compared with the ones associated with QTN, and 35 common candidate genes were found. Among these common candidate genes, four were possibly “pleiotropic.” This study provided important information for MAS and candidate gene functional studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Ruixian"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Juwu"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Xianghui"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Junwen"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Aiying"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Quanwei"},{"family":"Shang","given":"Haihong"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Yuzhen"},{"family":"Ge","given":"Qun"},{"family":"Iqbal","given":"Muhammad S."},{"family":"Deng","given":"Xiaoying"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shaoqi"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Jingtao"},{"family":"Duan","given":"Li"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Xianyan"},{"family":"Hafeez","given":"Abdul"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Quanjia"},{"family":"Geng","given":"Hongwei"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Wankui"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Youlu"}],"citation-key":"liu2018","container-title":"Frontiers in Plant Science","ISSN":"1664-462X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"GWAS Analysis and QTL Identification of Fiber Quality Traits and Yield Components in Upland Cotton Using Enriched High-Density SNP Markers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpls.2018.01067","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"liu2019a","abstract":"Early genome-wide association studies (GWASs) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, most of the heritability is due to huge numbers of common variants with tiny effect sizes. Previously, we argued that new models are needed to understand these patterns. Here, we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits are partitioned into direct effects from core genes and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting in trans. We propose that most heritability is driven by weak trans-eQTL SNPs, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak trans effects. Thus, our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Xuanyao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yang I."},{"family":"Pritchard","given":"Jonathan K."}],"citation-key":"liu2019a","container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014","ISSN":"0092-8674","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1022-1034.e6","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Trans Effects on Gene Expression Can Drive Omnigenic Inheritance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867419304003","volume":"177"},

Identification of the regulatory variants controlling the gene expression in response to drought, a major environmental threat of crop production worldwide, is of great value for drought-tolerant gene identification.\nResults: A total of 627 RNA-seq analyses are performed for 224 maize accessions which represent a wide genetic diversity under three water regimes; 73,573 eQTLs are detected for about 30,000 expressing genes with high-density genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms, reflecting a comprehensive and dynamic genetic architecture of gene expression in response to drought. The regulatory variants controlling the gene expression constitutively or drought-dynamically are unraveled. Focusing on dynamic regulatory variants resolved to genes encoding transcription factors, a drought-responsive network reflecting a hierarchy of transcription factors and their target genes is built. Moreover, 97 genes are prioritized to associate with drought tolerance due to their expression variations through the Mendelian randomization analysis. One of the candidate genes, Abscisic acid 8′-hydroxylase, is verified to play a negative role in plant drought tolerance.\nConclusions: This study unravels the effects of genetic variants on gene expression dynamics in drought response which allows us to better understand the role of distal and proximal genetic effects on gene expression and phenotypic plasticity.

After low-cost barcode-based deep sequencing, 412 edited sequences covering 118 genes were precisely identified from individuals showing clear phenotypic changes.

In the present study, we established a population of 976 maize F1 hybrids by crossing 488 diverse inbred lines with two elite testers. Genome-wide association study identified hundreds of quantitative trait loci associated with phenotypic plasticity variation across diverse F1 hybrids, the majority of which contributed very little variance, in accordance with the polygenic nature of these traits. We identified several quantitative trait locus regions that may have been selected during the tropical-temperate adaptation process. We also observed heterosis in terms of phenotypic plasticity, in addition to the traditional genetic value differences measured between hybrid and inbred lines, and the pattern of which was affected by genetic background.

  {"id":"liu2021a","abstract":"The intensive application of inorganic nitrogen underlies marked increases in crop production, but imposes detrimental effects on ecosystems1,2: it is therefore crucial for future sustainable agriculture to improve the nitrogen-use efficiency of crop plants. Here we report the genetic basis of nitrogen-use efficiency associated with adaptation to local soils in rice (Oryza sativa L.). Using a panel of diverse rice germplasm collected from different ecogeographical regions, we performed a genome-wide association study on the tillering response to nitrogen—the trait that is most closely correlated with nitrogen-use efficiency in rice—and identified OsTCP19 as a modulator of this tillering response through its transcriptional response to nitrogen and its targeting to the tiller-promoting gene DWARF AND LOW-TILLERING (DLT)3,4. A 29-bp insertion and/or deletion in the OsTCP19 promoter confers a differential transcriptional response and variation in the tillering response to nitrogen among rice varieties. The allele of OsTCP19 associated with a high tillering response to nitrogen is prevalent in wild rice populations, but has largely been lost in modern cultivars: this loss correlates with increased local soil nitrogen content, which suggests that it might have contributed to geographical adaptation in rice. Introgression of the allele associated with a high tillering response into modern rice cultivars boosts grain yield and nitrogen-use efficiency under low or moderate levels of nitrogen, which demonstrates substantial potential for rice breeding and the amelioration of negative environment effects by reducing the application of nitrogen to crops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Yongqiang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hongru"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Zhimin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Ruineng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Qihui"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhihua"},{"family":"Li","given":"Aifu"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Ou","given":"Shujun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiujie"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Shouyun"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Hongning"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yonghong"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Chengcai"}],"citation-key":"liu2021a","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-03091-w","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7847","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","number":"7847","page":"600-605","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Genomic basis of geographical adaptation to soil nitrogen in rice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03091-w","volume":"590"},

  {"id":"liu2021c","abstract":"Eukaryotic genomes are highly organised within the nucleus of a cell, allowing widely dispersed regulatory elements such as enhancers to interact with gene promoters through physical contacts in three-dimensional space. Recent chromosome conformation capture methodologies such as Hi-C have enabled the analysis of interacting regions of the genome providing a valuable insight into the three-dimensional organisation of the chromatin in the nucleus, including chromosome compartmentalisation and gene expression. Complicating the analysis of Hi-C data, however, is the massive amount of identified interactions, many of which do not directly drive gene function, thus hindering the identification of potentially biologically functional 3D interactions. In this review, we collate and examine the downstream analysis of Hi-C data with particular focus on methods that prioritise potentially functional interactions. We classify three groups of approaches: structural-based discovery methods, e.g. A/B compartments and topologically associated domains, detection of statistically significant chromatin interactions, and the use of epigenomic data integration to narrow down useful interaction information. Careful use of these three approaches is crucial to successfully identifying potentially functional interactions within the genome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Low","given":"Wai Yee"},{"family":"Alinejad-Rokny","given":"Hamid"},{"family":"Pederson","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Sadlon","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Barry","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Breen","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"liu2021c","container-title":"Epigenetics & Chromatin","container-title-short":"Epigenetics & Chromatin","DOI":"10.1186/s13072-021-00417-4","ISSN":"1756-8935","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,28]]},"page":"41","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Seeing the forest through the trees: prioritising potentially functional interactions from Hi-C","title-short":"Seeing the forest through the trees","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s13072-021-00417-4","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"liu2021d","abstract":"Both the lack or limitation of experimental data of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in plants and the independent evolutions of plant TFs make computational approaches for identifying plant TFBSs lagging behind the relevant human researches. Observing that TFs are highly conserved among plant species, here we first employ the deep convolutional neural network (DeepCNN) to build 265 Arabidopsis TFBS prediction models based on available DAP-seq (DNA affinity purification sequencing) datasets, and then transfer them into homologous TFs in other plants.DeepCNN not only achieves greater successes on Arabidopsis TFBS predictions when compared with gkm-SVM and MEME but also has learned its known motif for most Arabidopsis TFs as well as cooperative TF motifs with protein–protein interaction evidences as its biological interpretability. Under the idea of transfer learning, trans-species prediction performances on ten TFs of other three plants of Oryza sativa, Zea mays and Glycine max demonstrate the feasibility of current strategy.The trained 265 Arabidopsis TFBS prediction models were packaged in a Docker image named TSPTFBS, which is freely available on DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/r/vanadiummm/tsptfbs.

Analysis of biomass and survival among 732 resequenced genotypes, which were grown across 10 common gardens that span 1,800 km of latitude, jointly revealed extensive genomic evidence of climate adaptation. Climate–gene–biomass associations were abundant but varied considerably among deeply diverged gene pools. Furthermore, we found that gene flow accelerated climate adaptation during the postglacial colonization of northern habitats through introgression of alleles from a pre-adapted northern gene pool. The polyploid nature of switchgrass also enhanced adaptive potential through the fractionation of gene function, as there was an increased level of heritable genetic diversity on the nondominant subgenome. In addition to investigating patterns of climate adaptation, the genome resources and gene–trait associations developed here provide breeders with the necessary tools to increase switchgrass yield for the sustainable production of bioenergy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lovell","given":"John T."},{"family":"MacQueen","given":"Alice H."},{"family":"Mamidi","given":"Sujan"},{"family":"Bonnette","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Jenkins","given":"Jerry"},{"family":"Napier","given":"Joseph D."},{"family":"Sreedasyam","given":"Avinash"},{"family":"Healey","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Session","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Shu","given":"Shengqiang"},{"family":"Barry","given":"Kerrie"},{"family":"Bonos","given":"Stacy"},{"family":"Boston","given":"LoriBeth"},{"family":"Daum","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Deshpande","given":"Shweta"},{"family":"Ewing","given":"Aren"},{"family":"Grabowski","given":"Paul P."},{"family":"Haque","given":"Taslima"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Melanie"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Jiming"},{"family":"Kudrna","given":"Dave"},{"family":"Lipzen","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Pendergast","given":"Thomas H."},{"family":"Plott","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Saski","given":"Christopher A."},{"family":"Shakirov","given":"Eugene V."},{"family":"Sims","given":"David"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Manoj"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Ada"},{"family":"Singan","given":"Vasanth R."},{"family":"Tang","given":"Yuhong"},{"family":"Thibivillier","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Webber","given":"Jenell"},{"family":"Weng","given":"Xiaoyu"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Guohong Albert"},{"family":"Yoshinaga","given":"Yuko"},{"family":"Zane","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Li"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jiyi"},{"family":"Behrman","given":"Kathrine D."},{"family":"Boe","given":"Arvid R."},{"family":"Fay","given":"Philip A."},{"family":"Fritschi","given":"Felix B."},{"family":"Jastrow","given":"Julie D."},{"family":"Lloyd-Reilley","given":"John"},{"family":"Martínez-Reyna","given":"Juan Manuel"},{"family":"Matamala","given":"Roser"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Robert B."},{"family":"Rouquette","given":"Francis M."},{"family":"Ronald","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Saha","given":"Malay"},{"family":"Tobias","given":"Christian M."},{"family":"Udvardi","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Wing","given":"Rod A."},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yanqi"},{"family":"Bartley","given":"Laura E."},{"family":"Casler","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Devos","given":"Katrien M."},{"family":"Lowry","given":"David B."},{"family":"Rokhsar","given":"Daniel S."},{"family":"Grimwood","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Juenger","given":"Thomas E."},{"family":"Schmutz","given":"Jeremy"}],"citation-key":"lovell2021","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-03127-1","ISSN":"0028-0836, 1476-4687","issue":"7846","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,18]]},"language":"en","page":"438-444","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Genomic mechanisms of climate adaptation in polyploid bioenergy switchgrass","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03127-1","volume":"590"},
  {"id":"lu2015","abstract":"Background: Tetraploid cotton contains two sets of homologous chromosomes, the At-and Dt-subgenomes. Consequently, many markers in cotton were mapped to multiple positions during linkage genetic map construction, posing a challenge to anchoring linkage groups and mapping economically-important genes to particular chromosomes. Chromosome-specific markers could solve this problem. Recently, the genomes of two diploid species were sequenced whose progenitors were putative contributors of the At-and Dt-subgenomes to tetraploid cotton. These sequences provide a powerful tool for developing chromosome-specific markers given the high level of synteny among tetraploid and diploid cotton genomes. In this study, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) on each chromosome in the two diploid genomes were characterized. Chromosome-specific SSRs were developed by comparative analysis and proved to distinguish chromosomes. Results: A total of 200,744 and 142,409 SSRs were detected on the 13 chromosomes of Gossypium arboreum L. and Gossypium raimondii Ulbrich, respectively. Chromosome-specific SSRs were obtained by comparing SSR flanking sequences from each chromosome with those from the other 25 chromosomes. The average was 7,996 per chromosome. To confirm their chromosome specificity, these SSRs were used to distinguish two homologous chromosomes in tetraploid cotton through linkage group construction. The chromosome-specific SSRs and previously-reported chromosome markers were grouped together, and no marker mapped to another homologous chromosome, proving that the chromosome-specific SSRs were unique and could distinguish homologous chromosomes in tetraploid cotton. Because longer dinucleotide AT-rich repeats were the most polymorphic in previous reports, the SSRs on each chromosome were sorted by motif type and repeat length for convenient selection. The primer sequences of all chromosome-specific SSRs were also made publicly available. Conclusion: Chromosome-specific SSRs are efficient tools for chromosome identification by anchoring linkage groups to particular chromosomes during genetic mapping and are especially useful in mapping of qualitative-trait genes or quantitative trait loci with just a few markers. The SSRs reported here will facilitate a number of genetic and genomic studies in cotton, including construction of high-density genetic maps, positional gene cloning, fingerprinting, and genetic diversity and comparative evolutionary analyses among Gossypium species.","author":[{"family":"Lu","given":"Cairui"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Changsong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Youping"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Daoqian"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Hailiang"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Pengfei"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Wencui"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Qiaolian"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Xiaoxu"},{"family":"Prosper","given":"Mtawa Andrew"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Xiaoping"},{"family":"Song","given":"Guoli"}],"citation-key":"lu2015","container-title":"Bmc Genomics","DOI":"10.1186/s12864-015-1265-2","ISSN":"1471-2164","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,2,6]]},"note":"WOS:000349256700002","page":"55","title":"Development of chromosome-specific markers with high polymorphism for allotetraploid cotton based on genome-wide characterization of simple sequence repeats in diploid cottons (Gossypium arboreum L. and Gossypium raimondii Ulbrich)","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"lu2019","abstract":"Chromatin accessibility and modification is a hallmark of regulatory DNA, the study of which led to the discovery of cis-regulatory elements (CREs). Here, we characterize chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and sequence conservation in 13 plant species. We identified thousands of putative CREs and revealed that distal CREs are prevalent in plants, especially in species with large and complex genomes. The majority of distal CREs have been moved away from their target genes by transposable-element (TE) proliferation, but a substantial number of distal CREs also seem to be created by TEs. Finally, plant distal CREs are associated with three major types of chromatin signatures that are distinct from metazoans. Taken together, these results suggest that CREs are prevalent in plants, highly dynamic during evolution and function through distinct chromatin pathways to regulate gene expression.","author":[{"family":"Lu","given":"Zefu"},{"family":"Marand","given":"Alexandre P."},{"family":"Ricci","given":"William A."},{"family":"Ethridge","given":"Christina L."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaoyu"},{"family":"Schmitz","given":"Robert J."}],"citation-key":"lu2019","container-title":"Nature Plants","DOI":"10.1038/s41477-019-0548-z","ISSN":"2055-026X","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12]]},"note":"WOS:000501905000015","page":"1250-1259","title":"The prevalence, evolution and chromatin signatures of plant regulatory elements","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"luo","abstract":"Ear length (EL), controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL), is an important component of grain yield and as such a key target trait in maize breeding. However, very few EL QTL have been cloned and their molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, using genome wide association study (GWAS), we identified a QTL-YIGE1, which encodes an unknown protein that regulates EL by affecting pistillate floret number. Overexpression of YIGE1 enlarged female inflorescence meristem (IM) size, increased EL and kernel number per row (KNPR) thus enhanced grain yield. By contrast, CRISPR/Cas9 knock out or Mutator insertion mutant lines of YIGE1 displayed decreased IM size and EL. The SNP located in the regulatory region of YIGE1 had strong effect on its promoter strength which positively affected EL by increasing gene expression. Further analysis shows that YIGE1 may be involved in sugar and auxin signal pathways to regulate maize ear development, thus, affecting IM activity and floret production in maize inflorescence morphogenesis. These findings provide new insights of ear development and will ultimately facilitate maize molecular breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Mingliang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenqiang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Gengshen"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Min"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Wenjie"},{"family":"Jian","given":"Liumei"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jin"},{"family":"Fernie","given":"Alisdair R."},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jianbing"}],"citation-key":"luo","container-title":"New Phytologist","DOI":"10.1111/nph.17882","ISSN":"1469-8137","issue":"n/a","language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/nph.17882","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Genetic variation in YIGE1 contributes to ear length and grain yield in maize","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.17882","volume":"n/a"},

SOAPdenovo has been successfully applied to assemble many published genomes, but it still needs improvement in continuity, accuracy and coverage, especially in repeat regions.To overcome these challenges, we have developed its successor, SOAPdenovo2, which has the advantage of a new algorithm design that reduces memory consumption in graph construction, resolves more repeat regions in contig assembly, increases coverage and length in scaffold construction, improves gap closing, and optimizes for large genome.Benchmark using the Assemblathon1 and GAGE datasets showed that SOAPdenovo2 greatly surpasses its predecessor SOAPdenovo and is competitive to other assemblers on both assembly length and accuracy. We also provide an updated assembly version of the 2008 Asian (YH) genome using SOAPdenovo2. Here, the contig and scaffold N50 of the YH genome were ∼20.9 kbp and ∼22 Mbp, respectively, which is 3-fold and 50-fold longer than the first published version.

Comparisons among the 13 suites of orthologous linkage groups revealed that the A-genome chromosomes are largely collinear with the A(t) and D-t sub-genome chromosomes. Chromosomes associated with inversions suggested that allopolyploidization was accompanied by homologous chromosomal rearrangement.

  {"id":"ma2008a","abstract":"Asiatic cotton (Gossypium arboreum L.) is an Old World cultivated cotton species. The sinense race was planted extensively in China. Due to the advances in spinning technology during the last century, the species was replaced by the New World allotetraploid cotton G. hirsutum L. Gossypium arboreum is still grown in India and Pakistan and also used as an elite in current cotton breeding programs. In addition, G. arboreum serves as a model for genomic research in Gossypium. In the present study, we generated an A-genome diploid cotton intraspecific genetic map including 264 SSR loci with three morphological markers mapped to 13 linkage groups. The map spans 2,508.71 cM with an average distance of 9.4 cM between adjacent loci. A population containing 176 F-2:3 families was used to perform quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping for 17 phenotypes using Multiple QTL Model (MQM) of MapQTL ver 5.0. Overall, 108 QTLs were detected on 13 chromosomes. Thirty-one QTLs for yield and its components were detected in the F-2 population. Forty-one QTLs for yield and its components were detected in the F2,3 families with a total of 43 QTLs for fiber qualities. Two QTLs for seed cotton weight/plant and lint index and three QTLs for seed index were consistently detected both in F-2 and F-2:3. Most QTLs for fiber qualities and yields were located at the same interval or neighboring intervals. These results indicated that the negative correlation between fiber qualities and yield traits may result from either pleiotropic effect of one gene or linkage effects of multiple closely linked genes.","author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Xuexia"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Yezhang"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Baoliang"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Wangzhen"},{"family":"Lv","given":"Yanhui"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xiefei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tianzhen"}],"citation-key":"ma2008a","container-title":"Journal of Genetics and Genomics","DOI":"10.1016/S1673-8527(08)60231-3","ISSN":"1673-8527","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,12]]},"note":"WOS:000263427800007","page":"751-762","title":"QTL mapping in A-genome diploid Asiatic cotton and their congruence analysis with AD-genome tetraploid cotton in genus Gossypium","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},

DNA methylation regulates a range of processes involved in plant development and stress responses, but its role in male sterility under HT remains unknown. Here, we investigated DNA methylation levels in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) anthers under HT and normal temperature (NT) conditions by performing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to investigate the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in male fertility under HT. Global disruption of DNA methylation, especially CHH methylation (where H = A, C, or T), was detected in an HT-sensitive line. Changes in the levels of 24-nucleotide small-interfering RNAs were significantly associated with DNA methylation levels. Experimental suppression of DNA methylation led to pollen sterility in the HT-sensitive line under NT conditions but did not affect the normal dehiscence of anther walls. Further transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of genes in sugar and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic pathways were significantly modulated in anthers under HT, but auxin biosynthesis and signaling pathways were only slightly altered, indicating that HT disturbs sugar and ROS metabolism via disrupting DNA methylation, leading to microspore sterility. This study opens up a pathway for creating HT-tolerant cultivars using epigenetic techniques.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Yizan"},{"family":"Min","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Maojun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Chaozhi"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yunlong"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yaoyao"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Qidi"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yuanlong"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Sai"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Yuanhao"},{"family":"Su","given":"Xiaojun"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xueyuan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xianlong"}],"citation-key":"ma2018a","container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"The Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1105/tpc.18.00074","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,1]]},"page":"1387-1403","source":"Silverchair","title":"Disrupted Genome Methylation in Response to High Temperature Has Distinct Affects on Microspore Abortion and Anther Indehiscence","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.18.00074","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"mackay2009","abstract":"Most phenotypic variation in natural populations is attributable to multiple interacting loci, with allelic effects that are sensitive to the exact environmental conditions each individual experiences. The underlying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) can be mapped by linkage to polymorphic marker loci with clear Mendelian segregation such as molecular polymorphisms.QTLs can be mapped in families or segregating progeny of crosses between genetically divergent strains (linkage mapping) or in unrelated individuals from the same population (association mapping). In both cases, large numbers of individuals are needed to detect and localize QTLs; the number of individuals and genotypes per individual needed increases as the QTL effect size decreases and the precision of localization increases.Positional cloning is the gold standard of identifying genes that correspond to QTLs. Corroborating evidence that a gene causes the variation in the trait of interest includes replication in independent studies, identifying potentially functional DNA polymorphisms between alternative alleles of one of the candidate genes, showing a difference in mRNA expression levels between genotypes, showing that mRNA or protein is expressed in tissues that are thought to be relevant to the trait, and showing that mutations in candidate genes affect the trait or fail to complement QTL alleles.Results of QTL mapping efforts in many species over the past 20 years have showed that there are key common features of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits: many loci with small effects are responsible for most quantitative genetic variation, these loci are often unexpected based on prior knowledge of the trait or correspond to computationally predicted genes; the effects of QTL alleles are highly context-dependent and vary depending on genetic background, environment and sex; and pleiotropic QTL effects are widespread.Despite 20 years of intensive effort, we have fallen short of our long-term goal of explaining genetic variation for quantitative traits in terms of the underlying genes, the effects of segregating alleles in different genetic backgrounds and in a range of ecologically relevant environments, as well as their effects on other traits, the molecular basis of functional allelic effects and the population frequency of causal variants. The challenge of dissecting quantitative traits into individual genes and their causal molecular polymorphisms will be solved in the near future by applying new sequencing and genotyping technologies to the problem, in combination with new community resources.Understanding the biological context in which molecular polymorphisms elicit their effects on trait variation requires knowledge of the effects of the polymorphisms on complex networks of transcriptional, protein, metabolic and other molecular endophenotypes that lead to the organismal phenotype. This is the province of the emerging discipline of systems genetics.Systems genetics integrates DNA sequence variation, variation in transcript abundance and other molecular phenotypes, and variation in organismal phenotypes in a linkage or association mapping population and enables us to interpret quantitative genetic variation in terms of biologically meaningful causal networks of correlated transcripts. The association of molecular variation with organismal phenotypes identifies QTLs, the association of molecular variation with gene expression traits identifies expression QTLs and correlations between gene expression and organismal level phenotypes identify quantitative trait transcripts.Levels of expression of many transcripts covary between individuals in a mapping population; the correlated transcripts can be grouped statistically into modules, in which each module consists of transcripts with higher correlations to each other than to the rest of the transcriptome. The correlations between transcripts in a module can be visualized graphically as a network with nodes denoting transcripts and edges connecting nodes that are genetically correlated. Causal biological networks can be derived from coexpression transcriptional networks that are also correlated with the phenotype of an organism, using the statistical concept of conditional dependence. The statistical definition of the molecular interactions that govern phenotypic variation through natural genetic perturbations is a testable hypothesis that can be validated and refined by functional studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Mackay","given":"Trudy F.

This controversy arises because most genetic variation for quantitative traits is additive. However, additive variance is consistent with pervasive epistasis. In this Review, I discuss experimental designs to detect the contribution of epistasis to quantitative trait phenotypes in model organisms. These studies indicate that epistasis is common, and that additivity can be an emergent property of underlying genetic interaction networks.

Loci responsible for this genetic control are known as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). The resulting variation of gene expression across individuals has been postulated to be a determinant of phenotypic variation and susceptibility to complex disease. In the past, the application of expression microarray and genetic variation data to study populations enabled the rapid identification of eQTLs in model organisms and humans. Now, a new technology promises to revolutionize the field. Massively parallel RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides unprecedented resolution, allowing us to accurately monitor not only the expression output of each genomic locus but also reconstruct and quantify alternatively spliced transcripts. RNA-seq also provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying eQTLs.

In this work, we show that linkage disequilibrium induces significant gene–trait associations at non-causal genes as a function of the expression quantitative trait loci weights used in expression prediction. We introduce a probabilistic framework that models correlation among transcriptome-wide association study signals to assign a probability for every gene in the risk region to explain the observed association signal. Importantly, our approach remains accurate when expression data for causal genes are not available in the causal tissue by leveraging expression prediction from other tissues. Our approach yields credible sets of genes containing the causal gene at a nominal confidence level (for example, 90%) that can be used to prioritize genes for functional assays. We illustrate our approach by using an integrative analysis of lipid traits, where our approach prioritizes genes with strong evidence for causality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Mancuso","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Freund","given":"Malika K."},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Ruth"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Huwenbo"},{"family":"Kichaev","given":"Gleb"},{"family":"Gusev","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Pasaniuc","given":"Bogdan"}],"citation-key":"mancuso2019","container-title":"Nature Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-019-0367-1","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4]]},"language":"en","number":"4","page":"675-682","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Probabilistic fine-mapping of transcriptome-wide association studies","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0367-1","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"marcais2018","abstract":"The MUMmer system and the genome sequence aligner nucmer included within it are among the most widely used alignment packages in genomics. Since the last major release of MUMmer version 3 in 2004, it has been applied to many types of problems including aligning whole genome sequences, aligning reads to a reference genome, and comparing different assemblies of the same genome. Despite its broad utility, MUMmer3 has limitations that can make it difficult to use for large genomes and for the very large sequence data sets that are common today. In this paper we describe MUMmer4, a substantially improved version of MUMmer that addresses genome size constraints by changing the 32-bit suffix tree data structure at the core of MUMmer to a 48-bit suffix array, and that offers improved speed through parallel processing of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input size of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any biologically realistic length. We show that as a result of these enhancements, the nucmer program in MUMmer4 is easily able to handle alignments of large genomes; we illustrate this with an alignment of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which allows us to compute that the two species are 98% identical across 96% of their length. With the enhancements described here, MUMmer4 can also be used to efficiently align reads to reference genomes, although it is less sensitive and accurate than the dedicated read aligners. The nucmer aligner in MUMmer4 can now be called from scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby. These improvements make MUMer4 one the most versatile genome alignment packages available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Marçais","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Delcher","given":"Arthur L."},{"family":"Phillippy","given":"Adam M."},{"family":"Coston","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Salzberg","given":"Steven L."},{"family":"Zimin","given":"Aleksey"}],"citation-key":"marcais2018","container-title":"PLOS Computational Biology","container-title-short":"PLOS Computational Biology","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005944","ISSN":"1553-7358","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,26]]},"language":"en","page":"e1005944","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"MUMmer4: A fast and versatile genome alignment system","title-short":"MUMmer4","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005944","volume":"14"},

Data science theory and application has experienced a resurgence of research into techniques to detect or ”learn” patterns in noisy data in a variety of technical applications. Several variants of machine learning have been proposed for analyzing large DNA marker data sets to aid in phenotype prediction and genomic selection. Here, we present a review of the genomic prediction and machine learning literature. We apply deep learning techniques from machine learning research to six phenotypic prediction tasks using published reference datasets. Because regularization frequently improves neural network prediction accuracy, we included regularization methods in the neural network models. The neural network models are compared to a selection of regularized Bayesian and linear regression techniques commonly employed for phenotypic prediction and genomic selection. On three of the phenotype prediction tasks, regularized neural networks were the most accurate of the models evaluated. Surprisingly, for these data sets the depth of the network architecture did not aﬀect the accuracy of the trained model.

  {"id":"mcmullen2009","abstract":"Codifying Maize Modifications\nMaize, one of our most important crop species, has been the target of genetic investigation and experimentation for more than 100 years. Crossing two inbred lines tends to result in “better” offspring, in a process known as heterosis. Attempts to map the genetic loci that control traits important for farming have been made, but few have been successful (see the Perspective by Mackay). Buckler et al. (p. 714) and McMullen et al. (p. 737) produced a genomic map of maize that relates recombination to genome structure. Even tremendous adaptations in very diverse species were produced by numerous, small additive steps. Differences in flowering time in maize among inbred lines were not caused by a few genes with large effects, but by the cumulative effects of numerous quantitative trait loci—each of which has only a small impact on the trait.\nMaize genetic diversity has been used to understand the molecular basis of phenotypic variation and to improve agricultural efficiency and sustainability. We crossed 25 diverse inbred maize lines to the B73 reference line, capturing a total of 136,000 recombination events. Variation for recombination frequencies was observed among families, influenced by local (cis) genetic variation. We identified evidence for numerous minor single-locus effects but little two-locus linkage disequilibrium or segregation distortion, which indicated a limited role for genes with large effects and epistatic interactions on fitness. We observed excess residual heterozygosity in pericentromeric regions, which suggested that selection in inbred lines has been less efficient in these regions because of reduced recombination frequency. This implies that pericentromeric regions may contribute disproportionally to heterosis.\nOutcrossing vigor in maize is most likely due to retained variability in regions around the centromeres.\nOutcrossing vigor in maize is most likely due to retained variability in regions around the centromeres.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"McMullen","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Kresovich","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Villeda","given":"Hector Sanchez"},{"family":"Bradbury","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Li","given":"Huihui"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Flint-Garcia","given":"Sherry"},{"family":"Thornsberry","given":"Jeffry"},{"family":"Acharya","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Bottoms","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Browne","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Eller","given":"Magen"},{"family":"Guill","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Harjes","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Kroon","given":"Dallas"},{"family":"Lepak","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Mitchell","given":"Sharon E."},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Brooke"},{"family":"Pressoir","given":"Gael"},{"family":"Romero","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Rosas","given":"Marco Oropeza"},{"family":"Salvo","given":"Stella"},{"family":"Yates","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Hanson","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Glaubitz","given":"Jeffrey C."},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Major"},{"family":"Ware","given":"Doreen"},{"family":"Holland","given":"James B."},{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."}],"citation-key":"mcmullen2009","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1174320","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"5941","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,8,7]]},"language":"en","page":"737-740","PMID":"19661427","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Report","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Genetic Properties of the Maize Nested Association Mapping Population","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/325/5941/737","volume":"325"},

  {"id":"meng2021","abstract":"Enhancers located in introns are abundant and play a major role in the regulation of gene expression in mammalian species. By contrast, the functions of intronic enhancers in plants have largely been unexplored and only a handful of plant intronic enhancers have been reported and characterized. We performed a genome-wide prediction of intronic enhancers in Arabidopsis thaliana using open chromatin signatures based on DNase I sequencing. We identified 941 candidate intronic enhancers associated with 806 genes in seedling tissue and 1,271 intronic enhancers associated with 1,069 genes in floral tissue. We validated the function of 15 of 21 (71%) of the predicted intronic enhancers in transgenic assays using a reporter gene. We also created deletion lines of three intronic enhancers associated with two different genes using CRISPR/Cas. Deletion of these enhancers, which span key transcription factor binding sites, did not abolish gene expression but caused varying levels of transcriptional repression of their cognate genes. Remarkably, the transcriptional repression of the deletion lines occurred at specific developmental stages and resulted in distinct phenotypic effects on plant morphology and development. Clearly, these three intronic enhancers are important in fine-tuning tissue- and development-specific expression of their cognate genes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Meng","given":"Fanli"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Hainan"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Mingyu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Han","given":"Yingpeng"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Jiming"}],"citation-key":"meng2021","container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"The Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1093/plcell/koab093","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"koab093","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,25]]},"source":"Silverchair","title":"Genomic Editing of Intronic Enhancers Unveils Their Role in Fine-Tuning Tissue-Specific Gene Expression in Arabidopsis thaliana","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/plcell/koab093"},

  {"id":"meyer2012","abstract":"Ancient Genomics\nThe Denisovans were archaic humans closely related to Neandertals, whose populations overlapped with the ancestors of modern-day humans. Using a single-stranded library preparation method, Meyer et al. (p. 222, published online 30 August) provide a detailed analysis of a high-quality Denisovan genome. The genomic sequence provides evidence for very low rates of heterozygosity in the Denisova, probably not because of recent inbreeding, but instead because of a small population size. The genome sequence also illuminates the relationships between humans and archaics, including Neandertals, and establishes a catalog of genetic changes within the human lineage.\nWe present a DNA library preparation method that has allowed us to reconstruct a high-coverage (30×) genome sequence of a Denisovan, an extinct relative of Neandertals. The quality of this genome allows a direct estimation of Denisovan heterozygosity indicating that genetic diversity in these archaic hominins was extremely low. It also allows tentative dating of the specimen on the basis of “missing evolution” in its genome, detailed measurements of Denisovan and Neandertal admixture into present-day human populations, and the generation of a near-complete catalog of genetic changes that swept to high frequency in modern humans since their divergence from Denisovans.\nA close-up look provides clues to the relationships between modern humans, Denisovans, and Neandertals.\nA close-up look provides clues to the relationships between modern humans, Denisovans, and Neandertals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Kircher","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Gansauge","given":"Marie-Theres"},{"family":"Li","given":"Heng"},{"family":"Racimo","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Mallick","given":"Swapan"},{"family":"Schraiber","given":"Joshua G."},{"family":"Jay","given":"Flora"},{"family":"Prüfer","given":"Kay"},{"family":"Filippo","given":"Cesare","dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Sudmant","given":"Peter H."},{"family":"Alkan","given":"Can"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Qiaomei"},{"family":"Do","given":"Ron"},{"family":"Rohland","given":"Nadin"},{"family":"Tandon","given":"Arti"},{"family":"Siebauer","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Green","given":"Richard E."},{"family":"Bryc","given":"Katarzyna"},{"family":"Briggs","given":"Adrian W."},{"family":"Stenzel","given":"Udo"},{"family":"Dabney","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Shendure","given":"Jay"},{"family":"Kitzman","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Hammer","given":"Michael F."},{"family":"Shunkov","given":"Michael V."},{"family":"Derevianko","given":"Anatoli P."},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Andrés","given":"Aida M."},{"family":"Eichler","given":"Evan E."},{"family":"Slatkin","given":"Montgomery"},{"family":"Reich","given":"David"},{"family":"Kelso","given":"Janet"},{"family":"Pääbo","given":"Svante"}],"citation-key":"meyer2012","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.1224344","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6104","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,10,12]]},"language":"en","page":"222-226","PMID":"22936568","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Article","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"A High-Coverage Genome Sequence from an Archaic Denisovan Individual","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6104/222","volume":"338"},
  {"id":"meyer2021","abstract":"Lungfishes belong to lobe-fined fish (Sarcopterygii) that, in the Devonian period, ‘conquered’ the land and ultimately gave rise to all land vertebrates, including humans1–3. Here we determine the chromosome-quality genome of the Australian lungfish (Neoceratodus forsteri), which is known to have the largest genome of any animal. The vast size of this genome, which is about 14× larger than that of humans, is attributable mostly to huge intergenic regions and introns with high repeat content (around 90%), the components of which resemble those of tetrapods (comprising mainly long interspersed nuclear elements) more than they do those of ray-finned fish. The lungfish genome continues to expand independently (its transposable elements are still active), through mechanisms different to those of the enormous genomes of salamanders. The 17 fully assembled lungfish macrochromosomes maintain synteny to other vertebrate chromosomes, and all microchromosomes maintain conserved ancient homology with the ancestral vertebrate karyotype. Our phylogenomic analyses confirm previous reports that lungfish occupy a key evolutionary position as the closest living relatives to tetrapods4,5, underscoring the importance of lungfish for understanding innovations associated with terrestrialization. Lungfish preadaptations to living on land include the gain of limb-like expression in developmental genes such as hoxc13 and sall1 in their lobed fins. Increased rates of evolution and the duplication of genes associated with obligate air-breathing, such as lung surfactants and the expansion of odorant receptor gene families (which encode proteins involved in detecting airborne odours), contribute to the tetrapod-like biology of lungfishes. These findings advance our understanding of this major transition during vertebrate evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Meyer","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Schloissnig","given":"Siegfried"},{"family":"Franchini","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Du","given":"Kang"},{"family":"Woltering","given":"Joost M."},{"family":"Irisarri","given":"Iker"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Wai Yee"},{"family":"Nowoshilow","given":"Sergej"},{"family":"Kneitz","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Kawaguchi","given":"Akane"},{"family":"Fabrizius","given":"Andrej"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Peiwen"},{"family":"Dechaud","given":"Corentin"},{"family":"Spaink","given":"Herman P."},{"family":"Volff","given":"Jean-Nicolas"},{"family":"Simakov","given":"Oleg"},{"family":"Burmester","given":"Thorsten"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Elly M."},{"family":"Schartl","given":"Manfred"}],"citation-key":"meyer2021","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03198-8","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7845","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","number":"7845","page":"284-289","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Giant lungfish genome elucidates the conquest of land by vertebrates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03198-8","volume":"590"},

Using shared genetic control between distal DNAm sites, we constructed networks, identifying 405 discrete genomic communities enriched for genomic annotations and complex traits. Shared genetic variants are associated with both DNAm levels and complex diseases, but only in a minority of cases do these associations reflect causal relationships from DNAm to trait or vice versa, indicating a more complex genotype–phenotype map than previously anticipated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Min","given":"Josine L."},{"family":"Hemani","given":"Gibran"},{"family":"Hannon","given":"Eilis"},{"family":"Dekkers","given":"Koen F."},{"family":"Castillo-Fernandez","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Luijk","given":"René"},{"family":"Carnero-Montoro","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Lawson","given":"Daniel J."},{"family":"Burrows","given":"Kimberley"},{"family":"Suderman","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Bretherick","given":"Andrew D."},{"family":"Richardson","given":"Tom G."},{"family":"Klughammer","given":"Johanna"},{"family":"Iotchkova","given":"Valentina"},{"family":"Sharp","given":"Gemma"},{"family":"Al Khleifat","given":"Ahmad"},{"family":"Shatunov","given":"Aleksey"},{"family":"Iacoangeli","given":"Alfredo"},{"family":"McArdle","given":"Wendy L."},{"family":"Ho","given":"Karen M."},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Ashish"},{"family":"Söderhäll","given":"Cilla"},{"family":"Soriano-Tárraga","given":"Carolina"},{"family":"Giralt-Steinhauer","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Kazmi","given":"Nabila"},{"family":"Mason","given":"Dan"},{"family":"McRae","given":"Allan F."},{"family":"Corcoran","given":"David L."},{"family":"Sugden","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Kasela","given":"Silva"},{"family":"Cardona","given":"Alexia"},{"family":"Day","given":"Felix R."},{"family":"Cugliari","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Viberti","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Guarrera","given":"Simonetta"},{"family":"Lerro","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Richa"},{"family":"Bollepalli","given":"Sailalitha"},{"family":"Mandaviya","given":"Pooja"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Yanni"},{"family":"Clarke","given":"Toni-Kim"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Rosie M."},{"family":"Schmoll","given":"Vanessa"},{"family":"Czamara","given":"Darina"},{"family":"Ruiz-Arenas","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Rezwan","given":"Faisal I."},{"family":"Marioni","given":"Riccardo E."},{"family":"Lin","given":"Tian"},{"family":"Awaloff","given":"Yvonne"},{"family":"Germain","given":"Marine"},{"family":"Aïssi","given":"Dylan"},{"family":"Zwamborn","given":"Ramona"},{"family":"Eijk","given":"Kristel","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Dekker","given":"Annelot"},{"family":"Dongen","given":"Jenny","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Hottenga","given":"Jouke-Jan"},{"family":"Willemsen","given":"Gonneke"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Cheng-Jian"},{"family":"Barturen","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Català-Moll","given":"Francesc"},{"family":"Kerick","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Melton","given":"Phillip"},{"family":"Elliott","given":"Hannah R."},{"family":"Shin","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Bernard","given":"Manon"},{"family":"Yet","given":"Idil"},{"family":"Smart","given":"Melissa"},{"family":"Gorrie-Stone","given":"Tyler"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Al Chalabi","given":"Ammar"},{"family":"Ring","given":"Susan M."},{"family":"Pershagen","given":"Göran"},{"family":"Melén","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Jiménez-Conde","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Roquer","given":"Jaume"},{"family":"Lawlor","given":"Deborah A."},{"family":"Wright","given":"John"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Nicholas G."},{"family":"Montgomery","given":"Grant W."},{"family":"Moffitt","given":"Terrie E."},{"family":"Poulton","given":"Richie"},{"family":"Esko","given":"Tõnu"},{"family":"Milani","given":"Lili"},{"family":"Metspalu","given":"Andres"},{"family":"Perry","given":"John R.

  {"id":"monroe2022","abstract":"Since the first half of the twentieth century, evolutionary theory has been dominated by the idea that mutations occur randomly with respect to their consequences1. Here we test this assumption with large surveys of de novo mutations in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In contrast to expectations, we find that mutations occur less often in functionally constrained regions of the genome—mutation frequency is reduced by half inside gene bodies and by two-thirds in essential genes. With independent genomic mutation datasets, including from the largest Arabidopsis mutation accumulation experiment conducted to date, we demonstrate that epigenomic and physical features explain over 90% of variance in the genome-wide pattern of mutation bias surrounding genes. Observed mutation frequencies around genes in turn accurately predict patterns of genetic polymorphisms in natural Arabidopsis accessions (r = 0.96). That mutation bias is the primary force behind patterns of sequence evolution around genes in natural accessions is supported by analyses of allele frequencies. Finally, we find that genes subject to stronger purifying selection have a lower mutation rate. We conclude that epigenome-associated mutation bias2 reduces the occurrence of deleterious mutations in Arabidopsis, challenging the prevailing paradigm that mutation is a directionless force in evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Monroe","given":"J.

  {"id":"moore2022","abstract":"Plants respond to wounding stress by changing gene expression patterns and inducing the production of hormones including jasmonic acid. This wounding transcriptional response activates specialized metabolism pathways such as the glucosinolate pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana. While the regulatory factors and sequences controlling a subset of wound-response genes are known, it remains unclear how wound response is regulated globally. Here, we how these responses are regulated by incorporating putative cis-regulatory elements, known transcription factor binding sites, in vitro DNA affinity purification sequencing, and DNase I hypersensitive sites to predict genes with different wound-response patterns using machine learning. We observed that regulatory sites and regions of open chromatin differed between genes upregulated at early and late wounding time-points as well as between genes induced by jasmonic acid and those not induced. Expanding on what we currently know, we identified cis-elements that improved model predictions of expression clusters over known binding sites. Using a combination of genome editing, in vitro DNA-binding assays, and transient expression assays using native and mutated cis-regulatory elements, we experimentally validated four of the predicted elements, three of which were not previously known to function in wound-response regulation. Our study provides a global model predictive of wound response and identifies new regulatory sequences important for wounding without requiring prior knowledge of the transcriptional regulators.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Moore","given":"Bethany M"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yun Sun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Peipei"},{"family":"Azodi","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Grotewold","given":"Erich"},{"family":"Shiu","given":"Shin-Han"}],"citation-key":"moore2022","container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"The Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1093/plcell/koab287","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"page":"867-888","source":"Silverchair","title":"Modeling temporal and hormonal regulation of plant transcriptional response to wounding","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/plcell/koab287","volume":"34"},

Although citrus plants are among the most important fruit crops worldwide, the genetic basis of secondary metabolism in these plants is largely unknown. Here, we use a high-density linkage map to dissect large-scale flavonoid metabolic traits measured in different tissues (young leaf, old leaf, mature pericarp, and mature pulp) of an F1 pseudo-testcross citrus population. We detected 80 flavonoids in this population and identified 138 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for 57 flavonoids in these four tissues. Based on transcriptional profiling and functional annotation, twenty-one candidate genes were identified, and one gene encoding flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) was functionally verified to result in naturally occurring variation in dihydrokaempferol content through genetic variations in its promoter and coding regions. The abundant data resources collected for diverse citrus germplasms here lay the foundation for complete characterization of the citrus flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and will thereby promote efficient utilization of metabolites in citrus quality improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Mou","given":"Jiaolin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhehui"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Haiji"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Ziquan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Junli"},{"family":"Fernie","given":"Alisdair R."},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Yunjiang"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Xiuxin"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Weiwei"}],"citation-key":"mou2021","container-title":"Horticulture Research","DOI":"10.1038/s41438-021-00472-8","ISSN":"2052-7276","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"1-12","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Multiomics-based dissection of citrus flavonoid metabolism using a Citrus reticulata × Poncirus trifoliata population","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41438-021-00472-8","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"myles2009","abstract":"The goal of many plant scientists' research is to explain natural phenotypic variation in terms of simple changes in DNA sequence. Traditionally, linkage mapping has been the most commonly employed method to reach this goal: experimental crosses are made to generate a family with known relatedness, and attempts are made to identify cosegregation of genetic markers and phenotypes within this family. In vertebrate systems, association mapping (also known as linkage disequilibrium mapping) is increasingly being adopted as the mapping method of choice. Association mapping involves searching for genotype-phenotype correlations in unrelated individuals and often is more rapid and cost-effective than traditional linkage mapping. We emphasize here that linkage and association mapping are complementary approaches and are more similar than is often assumed. Unlike in vertebrates, where controlled crosses can be expensive or impossible (e.g., in humans), the plant scientific community can exploit the advantages of both controlled crosses and association mapping to increase statistical power and mapping resolution. While the time and money required for the collection of genotype data were critical considerations in the past, the increasing availability of inexpensive DNA sequencing and genotyping methods should prompt researchers to shift their attention to experimental design. This review provides thoughts on finding the optimal experimental mix of association mapping using unrelated individuals and controlled crosses to identify the genes underlying phenotypic variation.","author":[{"family":"Myles","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Peiffer","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Brown","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Ersoz","given":"Elhan S."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhiwu"},{"family":"Costich","given":"Denise E."},{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."}],"citation-key":"myles2009","container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1105/tpc.109.068437","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,8]]},"language":"eng","page":"2194-2202","PMCID":"PMC2751942","PMID":"19654263","source":"PubMed","title":"Association mapping: critical considerations shift from genotyping to experimental design","title-short":"Association mapping","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},
  {"id":"myles2011","abstract":"The grape is one of the earliest domesticated fruit crops and, since antiquity, it has been widely cultivated and prized for its fruit and wine. Here, we characterize genome-wide patterns of genetic variation in over 1,000 samples of the domesticated grape, Vitis vinifera subsp. vinifera, and its wild relative, V. vinifera subsp. sylvestris from the US Department of Agriculture grape germplasm collection. We find support for a Near East origin of vinifera and present evidence of introgression from local sylvestris as the grape moved into Europe. High levels of genetic diversity and rapid linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay have been maintained in vinifera, which is consistent with a weak domestication bottleneck followed by thousands of years of widespread vegetative propagation. The considerable genetic diversity within vinifera, however, is contained within a complex network of close pedigree relationships that has been generated by crosses among elite cultivars. We show that first-degree relationships are rare between wine and table grapes and among grapes from geographically distant regions. Our results suggest that although substantial genetic diversity has been maintained in the grape subsequent to domestication, there has been a limited exploration of this diversity. We propose that the adoption of vegetative propagation was a double-edged sword: Although it provided a benefit by ensuring true breeding cultivars, it also discouraged the generation of unique cultivars through crosses. The grape currently faces severe pathogen pressures, and the long-term sustainability of the grape and wine industries will rely on the exploitation of the grape's tremendous natural genetic diversity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Myles","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Boyko","given":"Adam R."},{"family":"Owens","given":"Christopher L."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Grassi","given":"Fabrizio"},{"family":"Aradhya","given":"Mallikarjuna K."},{"family":"Prins","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Andy"},{"family":"Chia","given":"Jer-Ming"},{"family":"Ware","given":"Doreen"},{"family":"Bustamante","given":"Carlos D."},{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."}],"citation-key":"myles2011","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1009363108","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3530-3535","PMID":"21245334","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Genetic structure and domestication history of the grape","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/108/9/3530","volume":"108"},

  {"id":"nasser2021","abstract":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of noncoding loci that are associated with human diseases and complex traits, each of which could reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease1. Many of the underlying causal variants may affect enhancers2,3, but we lack accurate maps of enhancers and their target genes to interpret such variants. We recently developed the activity-by-contact (ABC) model to predict which enhancers regulate which genes and validated the model using CRISPR perturbations in several cell types4. Here we apply this ABC model to create enhancer–gene maps in 131 human cell types and tissues, and use these maps to interpret the functions of GWAS variants. Across 72 diseases and complex traits, ABC links 5,036 GWAS signals to 2,249 unique genes, including a class of 577 genes that appear to influence multiple phenotypes through variants in enhancers that act in different cell types. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causal variants are enriched in predicted enhancers by more than 20-fold in particular cell types such as dendritic cells, and ABC achieves higher precision than other regulatory methods at connecting noncoding variants to target genes. These variant-to-function maps reveal an enhancer that contains an IBD risk variant and that regulates the expression of PPIF to alter the membrane potential of mitochondria in macrophages. Our study reveals principles of genome regulation, identifies genes that affect IBD and provides a resource and generalizable strategy to connect risk variants of common diseases to their molecular and cellular functions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Nasser","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Bergman","given":"Drew T."},{"family":"Fulco","given":"Charles P."},{"family":"Guckelberger","given":"Philine"},{"family":"Doughty","given":"Benjamin R."},{"family":"Patwardhan","given":"Tejal A."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Thouis R."},{"family":"Nguyen","given":"Tung H."},{"family":"Ulirsch","given":"Jacob C."},{"family":"Lekschas","given":"Fritz"},{"family":"Mualim","given":"Kristy"},{"family":"Natri","given":"Heini M."},{"family":"Weeks","given":"Elle M."},{"family":"Munson","given":"Glen"},{"family":"Kane","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Helen Y."},{"family":"Cui","given":"Ang"},{"family":"Ray","given":"John P."},{"family":"Eisenhaure","given":"Thomas M."},{"family":"Collins","given":"Ryan L."},{"family":"Dey","given":"Kushal"},{"family":"Pfister","given":"Hanspeter"},{"family":"Price","given":"Alkes L."},{"family":"Epstein","given":"Charles B."},{"family":"Kundaje","given":"Anshul"},{"family":"Xavier","given":"Ramnik J."},{"family":"Daly","given":"Mark J."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Hailiang"},{"family":"Finucane","given":"Hilary K."},{"family":"Hacohen","given":"Nir"},{"family":"Lander","given":"Eric S."},{"family":"Engreitz","given":"Jesse M."}],"citation-key":"nasser2021","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03446-x","ISSN":"1476-4687","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,7]]},"language":"en","page":"1-6","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Genome-wide enhancer maps link risk variants to disease genes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03446-x"},

To date, many studies rely on univariate statistical tests for association between the phenotype and each assayed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). However, interaction between SNPs, namely epistasis, must be considered when tackling the complexity of underlying biological mechanisms. Epistasis analysis at large scale entails a prohibitive computational burden when addressing the detection of more than two interacting SNPs. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic causal graph-based method, SMMB, to analyze epistatic patterns in GWAS data.We present Stochastic Multiple Markov Blanket algorithm (SMMB), which combines both ensemble stochastic strategy inspired from random forests and Bayesian Markov blanket-based methods. We compared SMMB with three other recent algorithms using both simulated and real datasets. Our method outperforms the other compared methods for a majority of simulated cases of 2-way and 3-way epistasis patterns (especially in scenarii where minor allele frequencies of causal SNPs are low). Our approach performs similarly as two other compared methods for large real datasets, in terms of power, and runs faster.Parallel version available on https://ls2n.fr/listelogicielsequipe/DUKe/128/.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Niel","given":"Clément"},{"family":"Sinoquet","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Dina","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Rocheleau","given":"Ghislain"}],"citation-key":"niel2018","container-title":"Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty154","ISSN":"1367-4803","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8,15]]},"page":"2773-2780","source":"Silverchair","title":"SMMB: a stochastic Markov blanket framework strategy for epistasis detection in GWAS","title-short":"SMMB","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty154","volume":"34"},

  {"id":"nozaki2012","abstract":"To study the regulatory mechanisms underlying lignin biosynthesis, we isolated and characterized lignescens (lig), a previously undescribed temperature-sensitive mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana that exhibits ectopic lignin deposition and growth defects under high-temperature conditions. The lig mutation was identified as a single base transition in GNA1 encoding glucosamine-6-phosphate N-acetyltransferase (GNA), a critical enzyme of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) biosynthesis. lig harbors a glycine-to-serine substitution at residue 68 (G68S) of GNA1. Enzyme activity assays of the mutant protein (GNA1G68S) showed its thermolability relative to the wild-type protein. The lig mutant exposed to the restrictive temperature contained a significantly smaller amount of UDP-GlcNAc than did the wild type. The growth defects and ectopic lignification of lig were suppressed by the addition of UDP-GlcNAc. Since UDP-GlcNAc is an initial sugar donor of N-glycan synthesis and impaired N-glycan synthesis is known to induce the unfolded protein response (UPR), we examined possible relationships between N-glycan synthesis, UPR, and the lig phenotype. N-glycans were reduced and LUMINAL BINDING PROTEIN3, a typical UPR gene, was expressed in lig at the restrictive temperature. Furthermore, treatment with UPR-inducing reagents phenocopied the lig mutant. Our data collectively suggest that impairment of N-glycan synthesis due to a shortage of UDP-GlcNAc leads to ectopic lignin accumulation, mostly through the UPR.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Nozaki","given":"Mamoru"},{"family":"Sugiyama","given":"Munetaka"},{"family":"Duan","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Uematsu","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Genda","given":"Tatsuya"},{"family":"Sato","given":"Yasushi"}],"citation-key":"nozaki2012","container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"The Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1105/tpc.112.102806","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,8,1]]},"page":"3366-3379","source":"Silverchair","title":"A Missense Mutation in the Glucosamine-6-Phosphate N-Acetyltransferase–Encoding Gene Causes Temperature-Dependent Growth Defects and Ectopic Lignin Deposition in Arabidopsis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.112.102806","volume":"24"},

We generated a catalog of sex differences in gene expression and in the genetic regulation of gene expression across 44 human tissue sources surveyed by the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx, v8 release). We demonstrate that sex influences gene expression levels and cellular composition of tissue samples across the human body. A total of 37% of all genes exhibit sex-biased expression in at least one tissue. We identify cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) with sex-differentiated effects and characterize their cellular origin. By integrating sex-biased eQTLs with genome-wide association study data, we identify 58 gene-trait associations that are driven by genetic regulation of gene expression in a single sex.

  {"id":"oziolor2019","abstract":"An unexpected advantage\nHuman activities are altering Earth's environment in many ways. Will other species be able to adapt in the face of rapid change? Adaptation requires genomic variability, but declining populations lose diversity, which casts doubt on adaptation as a survival mechanism in today's world. Oziolor et al. report a case of rapid adaptation to pollution in killifish, apparently enabled by introduction of a non-native congener within the last 30 generations (see the Perspective by Pfennig). This related species, possibly carried in ship ballast water, appears to have provided advantageous genetic variability that has allowed the native fish to adapt to its increasingly polluted environment.\nScience, this issue p. 455; see also p. 433\nRadical environmental change that provokes population decline can impose constraints on the sources of genetic variation that may enable evolutionary rescue. Adaptive toxicant resistance has rapidly evolved in Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) that occupy polluted habitats. We show that resistance scales with pollution level and negatively correlates with inducibility of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling. Loci with the strongest signatures of recent selection harbor genes regulating AHR signaling. Two of these loci introgressed recently (18 to 34 generations ago) from Atlantic killifish (F. heteroclitus). One introgressed locus contains a deletion in AHR that confers a large adaptive advantage [selection coefficient (s) = 0.8]. Given the limited migration of killifish, recent adaptive introgression was likely mediated by human-assisted transport. We suggest that interspecies connectivity may be an important source of adaptive variation during extreme environmental change.\nA non-native fish introduces toxicant-resistant genes to killifish threatened by pollution.\nA non-native fish introduces toxicant-resistant genes to killifish threatened by pollution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Oziolor","given":"Elias M."},{"family":"Reid","given":"Noah M."},{"family":"Yair","given":"Sivan"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Kristin M."},{"family":"VerPloeg","given":"Sarah Guberman"},{"family":"Bruns","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Joseph R."},{"family":"Whitehead","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Matson","given":"Cole W."}],"citation-key":"oziolor2019","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aav4155","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6439","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5,3]]},"language":"en","page":"455-457","PMID":"31048485","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Article","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Adaptive introgression enables evolutionary rescue from extreme environmental pollution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6439/455","volume":"364"},

However, the genetic mechanisms underlying plant architecture in diverse genetic backgrounds have not been fully addressed. Here, we performed a large-scale phenotyping of 10 plant architecture-related traits and dissected the genetic loci controlling these traits in 10 recombinant inbred line populations derived from 14 diverse genetic backgrounds. Nearly 800 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with major and minor effects were identified as contributing to the phenotypic variation of plant architecture-related traits. Ninety-two percent of these QTLs were detected in only one population, confirming the diverse genetic backgrounds of the mapping populations and the prevalence of rare alleles in maize. The numbers and effects of QTLs are positively associated with the phenotypic variation in the population, which, in turn, correlates positively with parental phenotypic and genetic variations. A large proportion (38.5%) of QTLs was associated with at least two traits, suggestive of the frequent occurrence of pleiotropic loci or closely linked loci. Key developmental genes, which previously were shown to affect plant architecture in mutant studies, were found to colocalize with many QTLs. Five QTLs were further validated using the segregating populations developed from residual heterozygous lines present in the recombinant inbred line populations. Additionally, one new plant height QTL, qPH3, has been fine-mapped to a 600-kb genomic region where three candidate genes are located. These results provide insights into the genetic mechanisms controlling plant architecture and will benefit the selection of ideal plant architecture in maize breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pan","given":"Qingchun"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Yuancheng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Kun"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Yong"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wenqiang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jianbing"}],"citation-key":"pan2017","container-title":"Plant Physiology","container-title-short":"Plant Physiol","DOI":"10.1104/pp.17.00709","ISSN":"0032-0889, 1532-2548","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"858-873","PMID":"28838954","publisher":"American Society of Plant Biologists","section":"Articles","source":"www.plantphysiol.org","title":"The Genetic Basis of Plant Architecture in 10 Maize Recombinant Inbred Line Populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/175/2/858","volume":"175"},
  {"id":"pan2021","abstract":"RNA-guided CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) systems have been developed in plants. However, the simultaneous activation of multiple genes remains challenging. Here, we develop a highly robust CRISPRa system working in rice, Arabidopsis and tomato, CRISPR–Act3.0, through systematically exploring different effector recruitment strategies and various transcription activators based on deactivated Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (dSpCas9). The CRISPR–Act3.0 system results in fourfold to sixfold higher activation than the state-of-the-art CRISPRa systems. We further develop a tRNA–gR2.0 (single guide RNA 2.0) expression system enabling CRISPR–Act3.0-based robust activation of up to seven genes for metabolic engineering in rice. In addition, CRISPR–Act3.0 allows the simultaneous modification of multiple traits in Arabidopsis, which are stably transmitted to the T3 generations. On the basis of CRISPR–Act3.0, we elucidate guide RNA targeting rules for effective transcriptional activation. To target T-rich protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs), we transfer this activation strategy to CRISPR–dCas12b and further improve the dAaCas12b-based CRISPRa system. Moreover, we develop a potent near-PAM-less CRISPR–Act3.0 system on the basis of the SpRY dCas9 variant, which outperforms the dCas9–NG system in both activation potency and targeting scope. Altogether, our study has substantially improved the CRISPRa technology in plants and provided plant researchers a powerful toolbox for efficient gene activation in foundational and translational research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Pan","given":"Changtian"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xincheng"},{"family":"Markel","given":"Kasey"},{"family":"Malzahn","given":"Aimee A."},{"family":"Kundagrami","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Sretenovic","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yingxiao"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Yanhao"},{"family":"Shih","given":"Patrick M."},{"family":"Qi","given":"Yiping"}],"citation-key":"pan2021","container-title":"Nature Plants","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"parekh2016","abstract":"Compared to tetraploid, diploid cotton especially Gossypium herbaceum are poor in genomic resources including molecular markers. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in public databases are valuable resources and offer opportunity for identification of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. ESTs data base of cotton were employed for the development of novel EST-SSR markers. Sequence assembly and clustering of 1,31,464 dbESTs (G. hirsutum, 92,570 and G. arboreum, 38,894) resulted in 28,718 unigenes (17,019 singletons and 11,699 contigs) having 1,760 SSRs. On an average, the unigenes contained 1 SSR/16.3 kb of unigene. The AG class was the most common among the dinucleotide motifs (45%), whereas the AAG class (25%) was predominant among the trinucleotide motif. A total of 378 novel primers pairs were developed from the ESTs of cotton fiber cells and ovules. A set of 60 primers associated with fiber development were selected and validated on a panel of 23 G. herbaceum and nine G. arboreum genotypes. Among 60, 44 primers d amplified 71 loci; of which 54 (76%) were polymorphic. The polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.11-0.74. The class II repeat SSR motifs were more polymorphic than class I repeat SSR markers. Nei's dissimilarity coefficients based on SSR markers among the all pair-wise combinations of genotypes ranged from 0.02 to 0.49 with a mean of 0.24. The UPGMA clustering grouped 32 genotypes in 2 clusters at cut off value of 0.23. The EST-SSR markers developed in our study would be best assets for characterization of germplasm, population structure analysis and QTL mapping in diploid cotton. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

  {"id":"partridge2020","abstract":"Transcription factors are DNA-binding proteins that have key roles in gene regulation1,2. Genome-wide occupancy maps of transcriptional regulators are important for understanding gene regulation and its effects on diverse biological processes3–6. However, only a minority of the more than 1,600 transcription factors encoded in the human genome has been assayed. Here we present, as part of the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project, data and analyses from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP–seq) experiments using the human HepG2 cell line for 208 chromatin-associated proteins (CAPs). These comprise 171 transcription factors and 37 transcriptional cofactors and chromatin regulator proteins, and represent nearly one-quarter of CAPs expressed in HepG2 cells. The binding profiles of these CAPs form major groups associated predominantly with promoters or enhancers, or with both. We confirm and expand the current catalogue of DNA sequence motifs for transcription factors, and describe motifs that correspond to other transcription factors that are co-enriched with the primary ChIP target. For example, FOX family motifs are enriched in ChIP–seq peaks of 37 other CAPs. We show that motif content and occupancy patterns can distinguish between promoters and enhancers. This catalogue reveals high-occupancy target regions at which many CAPs associate, although each contains motifs for only a minority of the numerous associated transcription factors. These analyses provide a more complete overview of the gene regulatory networks that define this cell type, and demonstrate the usefulness of the large-scale production efforts of the ENCODE Consortium.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Partridge","given":"E.

  {"id":"pasaniuc2017","abstract":"Summary association statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely available in large sample sizes across hundreds of complex traits. Analyses of such data can yield important insights, motivating the development of new statistical methods in this area.Single variant association analysis (including meta-analyses, conditional association and imputation) can be performed effectively using summary association data. These methods often rely on linkage disequilibrium (LD) information from population reference panels.Summary association data can be used to perform gene-based association tests to identify genes influencing complex traits. In particular, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) can be integrated to identify genes whose expression levels influence complex traits, and rare variant association tests can aggregate evidence of association across multiple rare variants in a gene.Statistical fine-mapping of causal variant (or variants) at GWAS loci can be performed using summary association data, leveraging information on the strength of association, functional genomic annotations and differences in LD patterns across different populations.It is becoming increasingly clear that most complex traits and common diseases have a large number of causal variants with small effects. Summary association statistics can be used to understand these polygenic architectures and leverage them for polygenic risk prediction.Summary association statistics have broad utility in cross-trait analyses, including detecting pleiotropic effects and inferring genetic correlations between traits. Pleiotropic effects can be used in Mendelian randomization analyses to draw inferences about causal relationships among traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Pasaniuc","given":"Bogdan"},{"family":"Price","given":"Alkes L."}],"citation-key":"pasaniuc2017","container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Genet","DOI":"10.1038/nrg.2016.142","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,2]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Reviews\nSubject_term: Genetic variation;Genome-wide association studies;Quantitative trait loci\nSubject_term_id: genetic-variation;genome-wide-association-studies;quantitative-trait-loci","number":"2","page":"117-127","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Dissecting the genetics of complex traits using summary association statistics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2016.142","volume":"18"},

We also uncover a general “phase change” phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy.

  {"id":"phillips2008","abstract":"Epistasis has been used to describe a number of phenomena, including the functional interaction between genes, the genetic outcome of mutations acting within the same genetic pathway, and the statistical deviation from additive gene action. Converging interests across genetics suggests that it is now time to develop a more unified view of epistasis and gene interactions.One of the traditional uses of epistasis analysis has been to order genes within developmental and metabolic pathways. These approaches have recently become much more systematic through the use of high-throughput genetic screens, especially in yeast. These studies show that gene interactions are ubiquitous and can be used to help understand the structure of complex genetic networks.The major limitation of comprehensive analyses of gene interactions is the total number of interactions that must ultimately be tested, which grows at approximately the square of the number of genes (for example, >18 million interactions in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome). Future work in this area will need to focus on particular subsets of this interaction space using information from other sources, such as functional genomics.Epistasis can be a major barrier to inferring the genetic basis of complex traits within natural populations. The effects of many QTLs might be obscured by interactions with other loci, which can make mapping difficult.Human genetic disease is one area in which epistasis seems to be fairly common, although we have few examples in which the functional basis of a particular interaction has been demonstrated. Epistasis is one possible explanation for why human mapping results can be difficult to replicate.Epistasis arises as a natural by-product of the evolutionary process, as all subsequent evolutionary change is built upon genetic changes that have occurred previously.There is clear evidence that epistasis helps to structure the possible pathways that evolution can follow but, even after nearly a century of debate on the topic, we still do not know if epistasis creates a major barrier to evolutionary change.An increased focus on the quantitative effects of gene interactions will provide the basis for a unified approach to studies of gene interaction, while providing a point of articulation between genetics, functional genomics, evolutionary genetics and systems biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Phillips","given":"Patrick C."}],"citation-key":"phillips2008","container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/nrg2452","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,11]]},"language":"en","number":"11","page":"855-867","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Epistasis — the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg2452","volume":"9"},

Our method improves on previous work by explicitly accounting for recent population history before performing the analyses. Using sequence data from the Environmental Genome Project, we find strong evidence for ancient admixture in both a European and a West African population (p ≈ 10−7), with contributions to the modern gene pool of at least 5%.

Here we show that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) can be used for de novo genotyping of breeding panels and to develop accurate GS models, even for the large, complex, and polyploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genome. With GBS we discovered 41,371 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a set of 254 advanced breeding lines from CIMMYT's semiarid wheat breeding program. Four different methods were evaluated for imputing missing marker scores in this set of unmapped markers, including random forest regression and a newly developed multivariate-normal expectation-maximization algorithm, which gave more accurate imputation than heterozygous or mean imputation at the marker level, although no significant differences were observed in the accuracy of genomic-estimated breeding values (GEBVs) among imputation methods. Genomic-estimated breeding value prediction accuracies with GBS were 0.28 to 0.45 for grain yield, an improvement of 0.1 to 0.2 over an established marker platform for wheat. Genotyping-by-sequencing combines marker discovery and genotyping of large populations, making it an excellent marker platform for breeding applications even in the absence of a reference genome sequence or previous polymorphism discovery. In addition, the flexibility and low cost of GBS make this an ideal approach for genomics-assisted breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Poland","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Endelman","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Dawson","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Rutkoski","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shuangye"},{"family":"Manes","given":"Yann"},{"family":"Dreisigacker","given":"Susanne"},{"family":"Crossa","given":"José"},{"family":"Sánchez-Villeda","given":"Héctor"},{"family":"Sorrells","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Jannink","given":"Jean-Luc"}],"citation-key":"poland2012","container-title":"The Plant Genome","DOI":"10.3835/plantgenome2012.06.0006","ISSN":"1940-3372","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.3835/plantgenome2012.06.0006","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Genomic Selection in Wheat Breeding using Genotyping-by-Sequencing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.3835/plantgenome2012.06.0006","volume":"5"},

We report a meta-analysis of twin correlations and reported variance components for 17,804 traits from 2,748 publications including 14,558,903 partly dependent twin pairs, virtually all published twin studies of complex traits. Estimates of heritability cluster strongly within functional domains, and across all traits the reported heritability is 49%. For a majority (69%) of traits, the observed twin correlations are consistent with a simple and parsimonious model where twin resemblance is solely due to additive genetic variation. The data are inconsistent with substantial influences from shared environment or non-additive genetic variation.

  {"id":"porcu2019","abstract":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of variants associated with complex traits, but their biological interpretation often remains unclear. Most of these variants overlap with expression QTLs, indicating their potential involvement in regulation of gene expression. Here, we propose a transcriptome-wide summary statistics-based Mendelian Randomization approach (TWMR) that uses multiple SNPs as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as exposures, simultaneously. Applied to 43 human phenotypes, it uncovers 3,913 putatively causal gene–trait associations, 36% of which have no genome-wide significant SNP nearby in previous GWAS. Using independent association summary statistics, we find that the majority of these loci were missed by GWAS due to power issues. Noteworthy among these links is educational attainment-associated BSCL2, known to carry mutations leading to a Mendelian form of encephalopathy. We also find pleiotropic causal effects suggestive of mechanistic connections. TWMR better accounts for pleiotropy and has the potential to identify biological mechanisms underlying complex traits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Porcu","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Rüeger","given":"Sina"},{"family":"Lepik","given":"Kaido"},{"family":"Santoni","given":"Federico A."},{"family":"Reymond","given":"Alexandre"},{"family":"Kutalik","given":"Zoltán"}],"citation-key":"porcu2019","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-019-10936-0","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,24]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Gene expression;Quantitative trait;Statistical methods\nSubject_term_id: gene-expression;quantitative-trait;statistical-methods","number":"1","page":"3300","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Mendelian randomization integrating GWAS and eQTL data reveals genetic determinants of complex and clinical traits","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10936-0","volume":"10"},

We propose a method to decompose the observational correlation between gene expression and phenotypes driven by confounders, forward- and reverse causal effects. The bi-directional causal effects between gene expression and complex traits are obtained by Mendelian Randomization integrating summary-level data from GWAS and whole-blood eQTLs. Applying this approach to complex traits reveals that forward effects have negligible contribution. For example, BMI- and triglycerides-gene expression correlation coefficients robustly correlate with trait-to-expression causal effects (rBMI = 0.11, PBMI = 2.0 × 10−51 and rTG = 0.13, PTG = 1.1 × 10−68), but not detectably with expression-to-trait effects.

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Purcell","given":"Shaun"},{"family":"Neale","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Todd-Brown","given":"Kathe"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Lori"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"Manuel A.

  {"id":"radersma2020","abstract":"Phenotypic responses to a novel or extreme environment are initially plastic, only later to be followed by genetic change. Whether or not environmentally induced phenotypes are sufficiently recurrent and fit to leave a signature in adaptive evolution is debated. Here, we analyze multivariate data from 34 plant reciprocal transplant studies to test: (1) if plasticity is an adaptive source of developmental bias that makes locally adapted populations resemble the environmentally induced phenotypes of ancestors; and (2) if plasticity, standing phenotypic variation and genetic divergence align during local adaptation. Phenotypic variation increased marginally in foreign environments but, as predicted, the direction of ancestral plasticity was generally well aligned with the phenotypic difference between locally adapted populations, making plasticity appear to 'take the lead' in adaptive evolution. Plastic responses were sometimes more extreme than the phenotypes of locally adapted plants, which can give the impression that plasticity and evolutionary adaptation oppose each other; however, environmentally induced and locally adapted phenotypes were rarely misaligned. Adaptive fine-tuning of phenotypes—genetic accommodation—did not fall along the main axis of standing phenotypic variation or the direction of plasticity, and local adaptation did not consistently modify the direction or magnitude of plasticity. These results suggest that plasticity is a persistent source of developmental bias that shapes how plant populations adapt to environmental change, even when plasticity does not constrain how populations respond to selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Radersma","given":"Reinder"},{"family":"Noble","given":"Daniel W.

We found expression asymmetries along wheat chromosomes, with homoeologs showing the largest inter-tissue, inter-cultivar, and coding sequence variation, most often located in high-recombination distal ends of chromosomes. These transcriptionally dynamic genes potentially represent the first steps toward neo- or subfunctionalization of wheat homoeologs.

One, the ‘Ancestral North Indians’ (ANI), is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans, whereas the other, the ‘Ancestral South Indians’ (ASI), is as distinct from ANI and East Asians as they are from each other. By introducing methods that can estimate ancestry without accurate ancestral populations, we show that ANI ancestry ranges from 39–71% in most Indian groups, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers. Groups with only ASI ancestry may no longer exist in mainland India. However, the indigenous Andaman Islanders are unique in being ASI-related groups without ANI ancestry. Allele frequency differences between groups in India are larger than in Europe, reflecting strong founder effects whose signatures have been maintained for thousands of years owing to endogamy.

  {"id":"roberts2021","abstract":"This book develops an effective theory approach to understanding deep neural networks of practical relevance. Beginning from a first-principles component-level picture of networks, we explain how to determine an accurate description of the output of trained networks by solving layer-to-layer iteration equations and nonlinear learning dynamics. A main result is that the predictions of networks are described by nearly-Gaussian distributions, with the depth-to-width aspect ratio of the network controlling the deviations from the infinite-width Gaussian description. We explain how these effectively-deep networks learn nontrivial representations from training and more broadly analyze the mechanism of representation learning for nonlinear models. From a nearly-kernel-methods perspective, we find that the dependence of such models' predictions on the underlying learning algorithm can be expressed in a simple and universal way. To obtain these results, we develop the notion of representation group flow (RG flow) to characterize the propagation of signals through the network. By tuning networks to criticality, we give a practical solution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. We further explain how RG flow leads to near-universal behavior and lets us categorize networks built from different activation functions into universality classes. Altogether, we show that the depth-to-width ratio governs the effective model complexity of the ensemble of trained networks. By using information-theoretic techniques, we estimate the optimal aspect ratio at which we expect the network to be practically most useful and show how residual connections can be used to push this scale to arbitrary depths. With these tools, we can learn in detail about the inductive bias of architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Roberts","given":"Daniel A."},{"family":"Yaida","given":"Sho"},{"family":"Hanin","given":"Boris"}],"citation-key":"roberts2021","container-title":"arXiv:2106.10165 [hep-th, stat]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,24]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"The Principles of Deep Learning Theory","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10165"},

Chromatin structural assays can efficiently integrate information across diverse regulatory elements, revealing the functional noncoding genome. In this study, we use a differential nuclease sensitivity assay based on micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion to discover open chromatin regions in the maize genome. We find that maize MNase-hypersensitive (MNase HS) regions localize around active genes and within recombination hotspots, focusing biased gene conversion at their flanks. Although MNase HS regions map to less than 1% of the genome, they consistently explain a remarkably large amount (∼40%) of heritable phenotypic variance in diverse complex traits. MNase HS regions are therefore on par with coding sequences as annotations that demarcate the functional parts of the maize genome. These results imply that less than 3% of the maize genome (coding and MNase HS regions) may give rise to the overwhelming majority of phenotypic variation, greatly narrowing the scope of the functional genome.","author":[{"family":"Rodgers-Melnick","given":"Eli"},{"family":"Vera","given":"Daniel L."},{"family":"Bass","given":"Hank W."},{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."}],"citation-key":"rodgers-melnick2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1525244113","ISSN":"1091-6490","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,5,31]]},"language":"eng","page":"E3177-3184","PMCID":"PMC4896728","PMID":"27185945","source":"PubMed","title":"Open chromatin reveals the functional maize genome","type":"article-journal","volume":"113"},

In recent years, increasing focus has been given to these variants, and how they can alter regulatory elements, such as enhancers, transcription factor binding sites and DNA methylation regions.

Concurrently, much effort has been put into establishing international consortia to undertake large projects aimed at discovering regulatory elements in different tissues, cell lines and organisms, and probing the effects of genetic variants on regulation by measuring gene expression. Here, we describe methods and techniques for discovering disease-associated non-coding variants using sequencing technologies. We then explain the computational procedures that can be used for annotating these variants using the information from the aforementioned projects, and prediction of their putative effects, including potential pathogenicity, based on rule-based and machine learning approaches. We provide the details of techniques to validate these predictions, by mapping chromatin–chromatin and chromatin–protein interactions, and introduce Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Associated Protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) technology, which has already been used in this ﬁeld and is likely to have a big impact on its future evolution.

  {"id":"ruth2021","abstract":"Reproductive longevity is essential for fertility and influences healthy ageing in women1,2, but insights into its underlying biological mechanisms and treatments to preserve it are limited. Here we identify 290 genetic determinants of ovarian ageing, assessed using normal variation in age at natural menopause (ANM) in about 200,000 women of European ancestry. These common alleles were associated with clinical extremes of ANM; women in the top 1% of genetic susceptibility have an equivalent risk of premature ovarian insufficiency to those carrying monogenic FMR1 premutations3. The identified loci implicate a broad range of DNA damage response (DDR) processes and include loss-of-function variants in key DDR-associated genes. Integration with experimental models demonstrates that these DDR processes act across the life-course to shape the ovarian reserve and its rate of depletion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that experimental manipulation of DDR pathways highlighted by human genetics increases fertility and extends reproductive life in mice. Causal inference analyses using the identified genetic variants indicate that extending reproductive life in women improves bone health and reduces risk of type 2 diabetes, but increases the risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms that govern ovarian ageing, when they act, and how they might be targeted by therapeutic approaches to extend fertility and prevent disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruth","given":"Katherine S."},{"family":"Day","given":"Felix R."},{"family":"Hussain","given":"Jazib"},{"family":"Martínez-Marchal","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Aiken","given":"Catherine E."},{"family":"Azad","given":"Ajuna"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"Deborah J."},{"family":"Knoblochova","given":"Lucie"},{"family":"Abe","given":"Hironori"},{"family":"Tarry-Adkins","given":"Jane L."},{"family":"Gonzalez","given":"Javier Martin"},{"family":"Fontanillas","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Claringbould","given":"Annique"},{"family":"Bakker","given":"Olivier B."},{"family":"Sulem","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Walters","given":"Robin G."},{"family":"Terao","given":"Chikashi"},{"family":"Turon","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Horikoshi","given":"Momoko"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Kuang"},{"family":"Onland-Moret","given":"N.

  {"id":"santana2021","abstract":"Candida auris is an emerging healthcare-associated pathogen of global concern. Recent reports have identified C. auris isolates that grow in cellular aggregates or filaments, often without a clear genetic explanation. To investigate the regulation of C. auris morphogenesis, we applied an Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system to all four C. auris clades. We identified aggregating mutants associated with disruption of chitin regulation, while disruption of ELM1 produced a polarized, filamentous growth morphology. We developed a transiently expressed Cas9 and sgRNA system for C. auris that significantly increased targeted transformation efficiency across the four C. auris clades. Using this system, we confirmed the roles of C. auris morphogenesis regulators. Morphogenic mutants showed dysregulated chitinase expression, attenuated virulence, and altered antifungal susceptibility. Our findings provide insights into the genetic regulation of aggregating and filamentous morphogenesis in C. auris. Furthermore, the genetic tools described here will allow for efficient manipulation of the C. auris genome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Santana","given":"Darian J."},{"family":"O’Meara","given":"Teresa R."}],"citation-key":"santana2021","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-021-27545-5","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,10]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Cellular microbiology;Fungal biology;Fungal genetics;Pathogens\nSubject_term_id: cellular-microbiology;fungal-biology;fungal-genetics;pathogens","number":"1","page":"7197","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Forward and reverse genetic dissection of morphogenesis identifies filament-competent Candida auris strains","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27545-5","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"sarni2020","abstract":"Common fragile sites (CFSs) are regions susceptible to replication stress and are hotspots for chromosomal instability in cancer. Several features were suggested to underlie CFS instability, however, these features are prevalent across the genome. Therefore, the molecular mechanisms underlying CFS instability remain unclear. Here, we explore the transcriptional profile and DNA replication timing (RT) under mild replication stress in the context of the 3D genome organization. The results reveal a fragility signature, comprised of a TAD boundary overlapping a highly transcribed large gene with APH-induced RT-delay. This signature enables precise mapping of core fragility regions in known CFSs and identification of novel fragile sites. CFS stability may be compromised by incomplete DNA replication and repair in TAD boundaries core fragility regions leading to genomic instability. The identified fragility signature will allow for a more comprehensive mapping of CFSs and pave the way for investigating mechanisms promoting genomic instability in cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Sarni","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Sasaki","given":"Takayo"},{"family":"Irony Tur-Sinai","given":"Michal"},{"family":"Miron","given":"Karin"},{"family":"Rivera-Mulia","given":"Juan Carlos"},{"family":"Magnuson","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Ljungman","given":"Mats"},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"David M."},{"family":"Kerem","given":"Batsheva"}],"citation-key":"sarni2020","container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-17448-2","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,17]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"3613","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"3D genome organization contributes to genome instability at fragile sites","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17448-2","volume":"11"},

We detected extensive spatiotemporal heterogeneity among progenitor cells and a gradual divergence in the regulatory programs of cerebellar neurons during differentiation. Comparisons to vertebrate genomes and snATAC-seq profiles for ∼20,000 cerebellar cells from the marsupial opossum revealed a shared decrease in CRE conservation during development and differentiation, but also differences in constraint between cell types.

  {"id":"schmid2005","abstract":"Regulatory regions of plant genes tend to be more compact than those of animal genes, but the complement of transcription factors encoded in plant genomes is as large or larger than that found in those of animals1. Plants therefore provide an opportunity to study how transcriptional programs control multicellular development. We analyzed global gene expression during development of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana in samples covering many stages, from embryogenesis to senescence, and diverse organs. Here, we provide a first analysis of this data set, which is part of the AtGenExpress expression atlas. We observed that the expression levels of transcription factor genes and signal transduction components are similar to those of metabolic genes. Examining the expression patterns of large gene families, we found that they are often more similar than would be expected by chance, indicating that many gene families have been co-opted for specific developmental processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmid","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Davison","given":"Timothy S."},{"family":"Henz","given":"Stefan R."},{"family":"Pape","given":"Utz J."},{"family":"Demar","given":"Monika"},{"family":"Vingron","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Schölkopf","given":"Bernhard"},{"family":"Weigel","given":"Detlef"},{"family":"Lohmann","given":"Jan U."}],"citation-key":"schmid2005","container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/ng1543","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2005,5]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research","number":"5","page":"501-506","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"A gene expression map of Arabidopsis thaliana development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ng1543","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"schmitz2022","abstract":"The identification and characterization of cis-regulatory DNA sequences and how they function to coordinate responses to developmental and environmental cues is of paramount importance to plant biology. Key to these regulatory processes are cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), which include enhancers and silencers. Despite the extraordinary advances in high-quality sequence assemblies and genome annotations, the identification and understanding of CRMs, and how they regulate gene expression, lag significantly behind. This is especially true for their distinguishing characteristics and activity states. Here, we review the current knowledge on CRMs and breakthrough technologies enabling identification, characterization, and validation of CRMs; we compare the genomic distributions of CRMs with respect to their target genes between different plant species, and discuss the role of transposable elements harboring CRMs in the evolution of gene expression. This is an exciting time to study cis-regulomes in plants; however, significant existing challenges need to be overcome to fully understand and appreciate the role of CRMs in plant biology and in crop improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Schmitz","given":"Robert J"},{"family":"Grotewold","given":"Erich"},{"family":"Stam","given":"Maike"}],"citation-key":"schmitz2022","container-title":"The Plant Cell","container-title-short":"The Plant Cell","DOI":"10.1093/plcell/koab281","ISSN":"1040-4651","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,1]]},"page":"718-741","source":"Silverchair","title":"Cis-regulatory sequences in plants: Their importance, discovery, and future challenges","title-short":"Cis-regulatory sequences in plants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/plcell/koab281","volume":"34"},

Polymorphisms between the 2 parents were detected using 1089 pairs of SSR primers and 520 RAPD primers. In total, 34 pairs of SSR primer-amplified and 18 RAPD primer-amplified polymorphic loci were selected to survey the F2 population. In total, 52 polymorphic DNA fragments were generated and used to construct a linkage map with JoinMap 3.0. A total of 45 loci and 5 phenotypic traits were mapped at a logarithm of odds ratio of >= 3.0 on 10 linkage groups. The total length of the map was 346 cM, and the average distance between adjacent markers was 7.7 cM. Chromosome assignments were made according to previous studies.

  {"id":"shao2019","abstract":"Utilization of heterosis has greatly increased the productivity of many crops worldwide. Although tremendous progress has been made in characterizing the genetic basis of heterosis using genomic technologies, molecular mechanisms underlying the genetic components are much less understood. Allele-specific expression (ASE), or imbalance between the expression levels of two parental alleles in the hybrid, has been suggested as a mechanism of heterosis. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of ASE by comparing the read ratios of the parental alleles in RNA-sequencing data of an elite rice hybrid and its parents using three tissues from plants grown under four conditions. The analysis identified a total of 3,270 genes showing ASE (ASEGs) in various ways, which can be classified into two patterns: consistent ASEGs such that the ASE was biased toward one parental allele in all tissues/conditions, and inconsistent ASEGs such that ASE was found in some but not all tissues/conditions, including direction-shifting ASEGs in which the ASE was biased toward one parental allele in some tissues/conditions while toward the other parental allele in other tissues/conditions. The results suggested that these patterns may have distinct implications in the genetic basis of heterosis: The consistent ASEGs may cause partial to full dominance effects on the traits that they regulate, and direction-shifting ASEGs may cause overdominance. We also showed that ASEGs were significantly enriched in genomic regions that were differentially selected during rice breeding. These ASEGs provide an index of the genes for future pursuit of the genetic and molecular mechanism of heterosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Shao","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Conghao"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Che","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xianmeng"},{"family":"Song","given":"Jiaming"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xianghua"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Jinghua"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Ling-Ling"},{"family":"Ouyang","given":"Yidan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qifa"}],"citation-key":"shao2019","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1820513116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,3,19]]},"language":"en","page":"5653-5658","PMID":"30833384","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Patterns of genome-wide allele-specific expression in hybrid rice and the implications on the genetic basis of heterosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/116/12/5653","volume":"116"},
  {"id":"shen2019","abstract":"Recombination breaks up ancestral linkage disequilibrium, creates combinations of alleles, affects the efficiency of natural selection, and plays a major role in crop domestication and improvement. However, there is little knowledge regarding the variation in the population-scaled recombination rate in cotton. We constructed recombination maps and characterized the difference in the genomic landscape of the population-scaled recombination rate between Gossypium hirsutum and G. arboreum and sub-genomes based on the 381 sequenced G. hirsutum and 215 G. arboreum accessions. Comparative genomics identified large structural variations and syntenic genes in the recombination regions, suggesting that recombination was related to structural variation and occurred preferentially in the distal chromosomal regions. Correlation analysis indicated that recombination was only slightly affected by geographical distribution and breeding period. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed with 15 agronomic traits using 267 cotton accessions and identified 163 quantitative trait loci (QTL) and an important candidate gene (Ghir_COL2) for early maturity traits. Comparative analysis of recombination and a GWAS revealed that the QTL of fibre quality traits tended to be more common in high-recombination regions than were those of yield and early maturity traits. These results provide insights into the population-scaled recombination landscape, suggesting that recombination contributed to the domestication and improvement of cotton, which provides a useful reference for studying recombination in other species.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Nian"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Maojun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xianlong"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Zhongxu"}],"citation-key":"shen2019","container-title":"The Plant Journal","DOI":"10.1111/tpj.14339","ISSN":"1365-313X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tpj.14339","page":"494-505","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Population genomics reveals a fine-scale recombination landscape for genetic improvement of cotton","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tpj.14339","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"shi2021","abstract":"To secure phosphorus (P) from soil, most land plants use a direct phosphate uptake pathway via root hairs and epidermis and an indirect phosphate uptake pathway via mycorrhizal symbiosis. The interaction between these two pathways is unclear. Here, we mapped a network between transcription factors and mycorrhizal symbiosis-related genes using Y1H. Intriguingly, this gene regulatory network is governed by the conserved P-sensing pathway, centered on phosphate starvation response (PHR) transcription factors. PHRs are required for mycorrhizal symbiosis and regulate symbiosis-related genes via the P1BS motif. SPX-domain proteins suppress OsPHR2-mediated induction of symbiosis-related genes and inhibit mycorrhizal infection. In contrast, plants overexpressing OsPHR2 show improved mycorrhizal infection and are partially resistant to P-mediated inhibition of symbiosis. Functional analyses of network nodes revealed co-regulation of hormonal signaling and mycorrhizal symbiosis. This network deciphers extensive regulation of mycorrhizal symbiosis by endogenous and exogenous signals and highlights co-option of the P-sensing pathway for mycorrhizal symbiosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Shi","given":"Jincai"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Boyu"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Shuang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaowei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaolin"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Wentao"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Qiujin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Gang"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Yunping"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Fan"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Nan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ertao"}],"citation-key":"shi2021","container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2021.09.030","ISSN":"00928674","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10]]},"language":"en","page":"5527-5540.e18","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A phosphate starvation response-centered network regulates mycorrhizal symbiosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867421011132","volume":"184"},

  {"id":"silva2014","abstract":"MOTIVATION: The detection of genomic regions unusually rich in a given pattern is an important undertaking in the analysis of next-generation sequencing data. Recent studies of chromosomal translocations in activated B lymphocytes have identified regions that are frequently translocated to c-myc oncogene. A quantitative method for the identification of translocation hotspots was crucial to this study. Here we improve this analysis by using a simple probabilistic model and the framework provided by scan statistics to define the number and location of translocation breakpoint hotspots. A key feature of our method is that it provides a global chromosome-wide nominal control level to clustering, as opposed to previous methods based on local criteria. While being motivated by a specific application, the detection of unusual clusters is a widespread problem in bioinformatics. We expect our method to be useful in the analysis of data from other experimental approaches such as of ChIP-seq and 4C-seq.\nRESULTS: The analysis of translocations from B lymphocytes with the method described here reveals the presence of longer hotspots when compared with those defined previously. Further, we show that the hotspot size changes substantially in the absence of DNA repair protein 53BP1. When 53BP1 deficiency is combined with overexpression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase, the hotspot length increases even further.

  {"id":"sonehara2020","abstract":"Genetic linkage analysis has made a huge contribution to the genetic mapping of Mendelian diseases. However, most previously available linkage analysis methods have limited applicability. Since parametric linkage analysis requires predefined model of inheritance with a fixed set of parameters, it is inapplicable without fully structured pedigree information. Furthermore, the analytical results are dependent on the specification of model parameters. While non-parametric linkage analysis can avoid these problems, the runs of homozygosity (ROH) mapping, a widely used non-parametric linkage analysis method, can only deal with recessive inheritance. The implementation of non-parametric linkage analyses capable of dealing with both dominant and recessive inheritance has been required.We have developed the Obelisc (Observational linkage scan), a flexibly applicable user-friendly non-parametric linkage analysis tool, which also provides an intuitive visualization of the analytical results. Obelisc is based on the SNP streak approach, which does not require any predefined inheritance model with parameters. In contrast to the ROH mapping, the SNP streak approach is applicable to both dominant and recessive traits. To illustrate the performance of Obelisc, we generated a pseudo-pedigree from the publicly available BioBank Japan Project genome-wide genotype dataset (n &gt; 180 000). By applying Obelisc to this pseudo-pedigree, we successfully identified the regions with inherited identical-by-descent haplotypes shared among the members of the pseudo-pedigree, which was validated by the population-based haplotype phasing approach.Obelisc is feely available at https://github.com/qsonehara/Obelisc as a python package with example datasets.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Sonehara","given":"Kyuto"},{"family":"Okada","given":"Yukinori"}],"citation-key":"sonehara2020","container-title":"Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa940","ISSN":"1367-4803","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,15]]},"page":"5567-5570","source":"Silverchair","title":"Obelisc: an identical-by-descent mapping tool based on SNP streak","title-short":"Obelisc","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa940","volume":"36"},

For example, previous studies using single-cell RNA sequencing identified at least 9 major cell types and up to 26 distinct subtypes in the dorsal cortex alone1,2. Here we characterize cell-type-specific cis-regulatory chromatin interactions, open chromatin peaks, and transcriptomes for radial glia, intermediate progenitor cells, excitatory neurons, and interneurons isolated from mid-gestational samples of the human cortex. We show that chromatin interactions underlie several aspects of gene regulation, with transposable elements and disease-associated variants enriched at distal interacting regions in a cell-type-specific manner. In addition, promoters with increased levels of chromatin interactivity—termed super-interactive promoters—are enriched for lineage-specific genes, suggesting that interactions at these loci contribute to the fine-tuning of transcription. Finally, we develop CRISPRview, a technique that integrates immunostaining, CRISPR interference, RNAscope, and image analysis to validate cell-type-specific cis-regulatory elements in heterogeneous populations of primary cells. Our findings provide insights into cell-type-specific gene expression patterns in the developing human cortex and advance our understanding of gene regulation and lineage specification during this crucial developmental window.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Song","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Pebworth","given":"Mark-Phillip"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiaoyu"},{"family":"Abnousi","given":"Armen"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Changxu"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Jia"},{"family":"Rosen","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Choudhary","given":"Mayank N.

Recent studies have shown that SVs can not only affect gene dosage but also modulate basic mechanisms of gene regulation. SVs can alter the copy number of regulatory elements or modify the 3D genome by disrupting higher-order chromatin organization such as topologically associating domains. As a result of these position effects, SVs can influence the expression of genes distant from the SV breakpoints, thereby causing disease. The impact of SVs on the 3D genome and on gene expression regulation has to be considered when interpreting the pathogenic potential of these variant types.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Spielmann","given":"Malte"},{"family":"Lupiáñez","given":"Darío G."},{"family":"Mundlos","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"spielmann2018","container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","DOI":"10.1038/s41576-018-0007-0","ISSN":"1471-0064","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,7]]},"language":"en","number":"7","page":"453-467","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Structural variation in the 3D genome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0007-0","volume":"19"},

Optionally, these factors can be interpreted as pathway or transcription factor activations by providing prior information about which genes are involved in the pathway or targeted by the factor. The inferred factors are used in genetic association analyses. First, they are treated as additional covariates, and are included in the model to increase detection power for mapping expression traits. Second, they are analyzed as phenotypes themselves to understand the causes of global expression variability.

  {"id":"stranger2012","abstract":"The genetic basis of gene expression variation has long been studied with the aim to understand the landscape of regulatory variants, but also more recently to assist in the interpretation and elucidation of disease signals. To date, many studies have looked in specific tissues and population-based samples, but there has been limited assessment of the degree of inter-population variability in regulatory variation. We analyzed genome-wide gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a total of 726 individuals from 8 global populations from the HapMap3 project and correlated gene expression levels with HapMap3 SNPs located in cis to the genes. We describe the influence of ancestry on gene expression levels within and between these diverse human populations and uncover a non-negligible impact on global patterns of gene expression. We further dissect the specific functional pathways differentiated between populations. We also identify 5,691 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) after controlling for both non-genetic factors and population admixture and observe that half of the cis-eQTLs are replicated in one or more of the populations. We highlight patterns of eQTL-sharing between populations, which are partially determined by population genetic relatedness, and discover significant sharing of eQTL effects between Asians, European-admixed, and African subpopulations. Specifically, we observe that both the effect size and the direction of effect for eQTLs are highly conserved across populations. We observe an increasing proximity of eQTLs toward the transcription start site as sharing of eQTLs among populations increases, highlighting that variants close to TSS have stronger effects and therefore are more likely to be detected across a wider panel of populations. Together these results offer a unique picture and resource of the degree of differentiation among human populations in functional regulatory variation and provide an estimate for the transferability of complex trait variants across populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Stranger","given":"Barbara E."},{"family":"Montgomery","given":"Stephen B."},{"family":"Dimas","given":"Antigone S."},{"family":"Parts","given":"Leopold"},{"family":"Stegle","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Ingle","given":"Catherine E."},{"family":"Sekowska","given":"Magda"},{"family":"Smith","given":"George Davey"},{"family":"Evans","given":"David"},{"family":"Gutierrez-Arcelus","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Price","given":"Alkes"},{"family":"Raj","given":"Towfique"},{"family":"Nisbett","given":"James"},{"family":"Nica","given":"Alexandra C."},{"family":"Beazley","given":"Claude"},{"family":"Durbin","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Deloukas","given":"Panos"},{"family":"Dermitzakis","given":"Emmanouil T."}],"citation-key":"stranger2012","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1002639","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,4,19]]},"language":"en","page":"e1002639","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Patterns of Cis Regulatory Variation in Diverse Human Populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002639","volume":"8"},

We identified hundreds of dynamic eQTLs that change over time, with enrichment in enhancers of relevant cell types. We also found nonlinear dynamic eQTLs, which affect only intermediate stages of differentiation and cannot be found by using data from mature tissues.

  {"id":"su2010","abstract":"This study investigated the reliability of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) in the Danish Holstein population. The data in the analysis included 3,330 bulls with both published conventional EBV and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. After data editing, 38,134 SNP markers were available. In the analysis, all SNP were fitted simultaneously as random effects in a Bayesian variable selection model, which allows heterogeneous variances for different SNP markers. The response variables were the official EBV. Direct GEBV were calculated as the sum of individual SNP effects. Initial analyses of 4 index traits were carried out to compare models with different intensities of shrinkage for SNP effects; that is, mixture prior distributions of scaling factors (standard deviation of SNP effects) assuming 5, 10, 20, or 50% of SNP having large effects and the others having very small or no effects, and a single prior distribution common for all SNP. It was found that, in general, the model with a common prior distribution of scaling factors had better predictive ability than any mixture prior models. Therefore, a common prior model was used to estimate SNP effects and breeding values for all 18 index traits. Reliability of GEBV was assessed by squared correlation between GEBV and conventional EBV (r2GEBV, EBV), and expected reliability was obtained from prediction error variance using a 5-fold cross validation. Squared correlations between GEBV and published EBV (without any adjustment) ranged from 0.252 to 0.700, with an average of 0.418. Expected reliabilities ranged from 0.494 to 0.733, with an average of 0.546. Averaged over 18 traits, r2GEBV, EBV was 0.13 higher and expected reliability was 0.26 higher than reliability of conventional parent average. The results indicate that genomic selection can greatly improve the accuracy of preselection for young bulls compared with traditional selection based on parent average information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Su","given":"G."},{"family":"Guldbrandtsen","given":"B."},{"family":"Gregersen","given":"V.

  {"id":"sun2017a","abstract":"Genetic improvement of fibre quality is one of the main breeding goals for the upland cotton, Gossypium hirsutum, but there are difficulties with precise selection of traits. Therefore, it is important to improve the understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic variation. In this study, we conducted phenotyping and genetic variation analyses of 719 diverse accessions of upland cotton based on multiple environment tests and a recently developed Cotton 63K Illumina Infinium SNP array and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of fibre quality traits. A total of 10 511 polymorphic SNPs distributed in 26 chromosomes were screened across the cotton germplasms, and forty-six significant SNPs associated with five fibre quality traits were detected. These significant SNPs were scattered over 15 chromosomes and were involved in 612 unique candidate genes, many related to polysaccharide biosynthesis, signal transduction and protein translocation. Two major haplotypes for fibre length and strength were identified on chromosomes Dt11 and At07. Furthermore, by combining GWAS and transcriptome analysis, we identified 163 and 120 fibre developmental genes related to length and strength, respectively, of which a number of novel genes and 19 promising genes were screened. These results provide new insight into the genetic basis of fibre quality in G. hirsutum and provide candidate SNPs and genes to accelerate the improvement of upland cotton.","author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Zhengwen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xingfen"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Zhengwen"},{"family":"Gu","given":"Qishen"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhikun"},{"family":"Ke","given":"Huifeng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jinhua"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Liqiang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guiyin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Caiying"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Zhiying"}],"citation-key":"sun2017a","container-title":"Plant Biotechnology Journal","container-title-short":"Plant Biotechnol J","DOI":"10.1111/pbi.12693","ISSN":"1467-7652","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,8]]},"language":"eng","page":"982-996","PMCID":"PMC5506648","PMID":"28064470","source":"PubMed","title":"Genome-wide association study discovered genetic variation and candidate genes of fibre quality traits in Gossypium hirsutum L","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},
  {"id":"sun2020","abstract":"Over the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered thousands of genetic variants underlying complex human diseases and agriculturally important traits. These findings have been utilized to dissect the biological basis of diseases, to develop new drugs, to advance precision medicine and to boost breeding. However, the potential of GWAS is still underexploited due to methodological limitations. Many challenges have emerged, including detecting epistasis and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with small effects and distinguishing causal variants from other SNPs associated through linkage disequilibrium. These issues have motivated advancements in GWAS analyses in two contrasting cultures—statistical modelling and machine learning. In this review, we systematically present the basic concepts and the benefits and limitations in both methods. We further discuss recent efforts to mitigate their weaknesses. Additionally, we summarize the state-of-the-art tools for detecting the missed signals, ultrarare mutations and gene–gene interactions and for prioritizing SNPs. Our work can offer both theoretical and practical guidelines for performing GWAS analyses and for developing further new robust methods to fully exploit the potential of GWAS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Shanwen"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Benzhi"},{"family":"Zou","given":"Quan"}],"citation-key":"sun2020","container-title":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bib/bbaa263","ISSN":"1477-4054","issue":"bbaa263","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,30]]},"source":"Silverchair","title":"Revisiting genome-wide association studies from statistical modelling to machine learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa263"},

In the present study, we report the haplotype-resolved genomes of the cultivated apple (Malus domestica cv. Gala) and its two major wild progenitors, M. sieversii and M. sylvestris. Substantial variations are identified between the two haplotypes of each genome. Inference of genome ancestry identifies ~23% of the Gala genome as of hybrid origin. Deep sequencing of 91 accessions identifies selective sweeps in cultivated apples that originated from either of the two progenitors and are associated with important domestication traits. Construction and analyses of apple pan-genomes uncover thousands of new genes, with hundreds of them being selected from one of the progenitors and largely fixed in cultivated apples, revealing that introgression of new genes/alleles is a hallmark of apple domestication through hybridization. Finally, transcriptome profiles of Gala fruits at 13 developmental stages unravel ~19% of genes displaying allele-specific expression, including many associated with fruit quality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Xuepeng"},{"family":"Jiao","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Schwaninger","given":"Heidi"},{"family":"Chao","given":"C.

However, GWAS have so far remained largely underpowered in relation to identifying associations in the rare and low-frequency allelic spectrum and have lacked the resolution to trace causal mechanisms to underlying genes1. Here we combined whole-exome sequencing in 392,814 UK Biobank participants with imputed genotypes from 260,405 FinnGen participants (653,219 total individuals) to conduct association meta-analyses for 744 disease endpoints across the protein-coding allelic frequency spectrum, bridging the gap between common and rare variant studies. We identified 975 associations, with more than one-third being previously unreported. We demonstrate population-level relevance for mutations previously ascribed to causing single-gene disorders, map GWAS associations to likely causal genes, explain disease mechanisms, and systematically relate disease associations to levels of 117 biomarkers and clinical-stage drug targets. Combining sequencing and genotyping in two population biobanks enabled us to benefit from increased power to detect and explain disease associations, validate findings through replication and propose medical actionability for rare genetic variants.

  {"id":"tang2021","abstract":"Citrus canker caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) is one of the most devastating diseases in citrus industry worldwide. Most citrus cultivars such as sweet orange are susceptible to canker disease. Here, we utilized wild citrus to identify canker-resistant germplasms, and found that Atalantia buxifolia, a primitive (distant-wild) citrus, exhibited remarkable resistance to canker disease. Although the susceptibility gene LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES 1 (LOB1) could also be induced in Atalantia after canker infection, the induction extent was far lower than that in sweet orange. In addition, three of amino acids encoded by transcription factor TFIIAγ in Atalantia (AbTFIIAγ) exhibited difference from those in sweet orange (CsTFIIAγ) which could stabilize the interaction between effector PthA4 and effector binding element (EBE) of LOB1 promoter. The mutation of AbTFIIAγ did not change its interaction with transcription factor binding motifs (TFBs). However, the AbTFIIAγ could hardly support the LOB1 expression induced by the PthA4. In addition, the activity of AbLOB1 promoter was significantly lower than that of CsLOB1 under the induction by PthA4. Our results demonstrate that natural variations of AbTFIIAγ and effector binding element (EBE) in the AbLOB1 promoter are crucial for the canker disease resistance of Atalantia.

Here, we decipher the genetic basis of natural variation in SOC of Brassica napus by genome- and transcriptome-wide association studies using 505 inbred lines. We mapped reliable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control SOC in eight environments, evaluated the effect of each QTL on SOC, and analyzed selection in QTL regions during breeding. Six-hundred and ninety-two genes and four gene modules significantly associated with SOC were identified by analyzing population transcriptomes from seeds. A gene prioritization framework, POCKET (prioritizing the candidate genes by incorporating information on knowledge-based gene sets, effects of variants, genome-wide association studies, and transcriptome-wide association studies), was implemented to determine the causal genes in the QTL regions based on multi-omic datasets. A pair of homologous genes, BnPMT6s, in two QTLs were identified and experimentally demonstrated to negatively regulate SOC. This study provides rich genetic resources for improving SOC and valuable insights toward understanding the complex machinery that directs oil accumulation in the seeds of B. napus and other oil crops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Tang","given":"Shan"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Hu"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Shaoping"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Liangqian"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Guofang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuting"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Qing-Yong"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yongming"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xuemin"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Weibo"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Liang"}],"citation-key":"tang2021a","container-title":"Molecular Plant","container-title-short":"Molecular Plant","DOI":"10.1016/j.molp.2020.12.003","ISSN":"1674-2052","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"470-487","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Genome- and transcriptome-wide association studies provide insights into the genetic basis of natural variation of seed oil content in Brassica napus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674205220304342","volume":"14"},

One obstacle to their application is the structured populations often found in crop plants3, which may lead to nonfunctional, spurious associations4. In this study, statistical methods to account for population structure5 were extended for use with quantitative variation and applied to our evaluation of maize flowering time. Mutagenesis and quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies suggested that the maize gene Dwarf8 might affect the quantitative variation of maize flowering time and plant height6,7,8. The wheat orthologs of this gene contributed to the increased yields seen in the 'Green Revolution' varieties6. We used association approaches to evaluate Dwarf8 sequence polymorphisms from 92 maize inbred lines. Population structure was estimated using a Bayesian analysis4 of 141 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci. Our results indicate that a suite of polymorphisms associate with differences in flowering time, which include a deletion that may alter a key domain in the coding region. The distribution of nonsynonymous polymorphisms suggests that Dwarf8 has been a target of selection.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Thornsberry","given":"Jeffry M."},{"family":"Goodman","given":"Major M."},{"family":"Doebley","given":"John"},{"family":"Kresovich","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Dahlia"},{"family":"Buckler","given":"Edward S."}],"citation-key":"thornsberry2001","container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/90135","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2001,7]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research","number":"3","page":"286-289","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Dwarf8 polymorphisms associate with variation in flowering time","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ng0701_286","volume":"28"},

Each of these has its own merits and disadvantages, but all are subject to the limitations of sample size. Gene mapping studies should thus be tailored to the unique contributions of each of these technologies.To date, the observed genetic architecture of highly heritable diseases and traits differs markedly and cannot be reliably predicted. Where large sample sizes are available, differences in detectable architecture still exist.The concept of variance explained is not always relevant to individual-level risk prediction or drug development, whereas the genetic architecture of a given trait or disease can be more pertinent.Genetic architecture is variable in time and place and can be theoretically influenced by phenotypic measurement, selection and decanalization.Interactions between genetic determinants of a trait or environmental influences contribute to genetic architecture. To date, few such interactions have been identified for most common diseases and traits, but this will likely change with increasing sample sizes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Timpson","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Greenwood","given":"Celia M.

Limited recombination in these haplotype blocks keeps adaptive alleles together, and these regions differentiate sunflower ecotypes. For example, haplotype blocks control a 77-day difference in flowering between ecotypes of the silverleaf sunflower H. argophyllus (probably through deletion of a homologue of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)), and are associated with seed size, flowering time and soil fertility in dune-adapted sunflowers. These haplotypes are highly divergent, frequently associated with structural variants and often appear to represent introgressions from other—possibly now-extinct—congeners.

Genomic selection uses molecular markers and machine learning to identify superior genotypes with improved traits, such as growth. Plant growth directly depends on rates of metabolic reactions which transform nutrients into the building blocks of biomass. Here, we predict growth of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions by employing genomic prediction of reaction rates estimated from accession-specific metabolic models. We demonstrate that, comparing to classical genomic selection on the available data sets for 67 accessions, our approach improves the prediction accuracy for growth within and across nitrogen environments by 32.6% and 51.4%, respectively, and from optimal nitrogen to low carbon environment by 50.4%. Therefore, integration of molecular markers into metabolic models offers an approach to predict traits directly related to metabolism, and its usefulness in breeding can be examined by gathering matching datasets in crops.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Tong","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Küken","given":"Anika"},{"family":"Nikoloski","given":"Zoran"}],"citation-key":"tong2020","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-16279-5","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,15]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Agricultural genetics;Data integration;Genetic markers;Secondary metabolism\nSubject_term_id: agricultural-genetics;data-integration;genetic-markers;secondary-metabolism","number":"1","page":"2410","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Integrating molecular markers into metabolic models improves genomic selection for Arabidopsis growth","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-16279-5","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"underwood2022","abstract":"Apomixis, the clonal formation of seeds, is a rare yet widely distributed trait in flowering plants. We have isolated the PARTHENOGENESIS (PAR) gene from apomictic dandelion that triggers embryo development in unfertilized egg cells. PAR encodes a K2-2 zinc finger, EAR-domain protein. Unlike the recessive sexual alleles, the dominant PAR allele is expressed in egg cells and has a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) transposon insertion in the promoter. The MITE-containing promoter can invoke a homologous gene from sexual lettuce to complement dandelion LOSS OF PARTHENOGENESIS mutants. A similar MITE is also present in the promoter of the PAR gene in apomictic forms of hawkweed, suggesting a case of parallel evolution. Heterologous expression of dandelion PAR in lettuce egg cells induced haploid embryo-like structures in the absence of fertilization. Sexual PAR alleles are expressed in pollen, suggesting that the gene product releases a block on embryogenesis after fertilization in sexual species while in apomictic species PAR expression triggers embryogenesis in the absence of fertilization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Underwood","given":"Charles J."},{"family":"Vijverberg","given":"Kitty"},{"family":"Rigola","given":"Diana"},{"family":"Okamoto","given":"Shunsuke"},{"family":"Oplaat","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Camp","given":"Rik H.

  {"id":"urbut2019","abstract":"We introduce new statistical methods for analyzing genomic data sets that measure many effects in many conditions (for example, gene expression changes under many treatments). These new methods improve on existing methods by allowing for arbitrary correlations in effect sizes among conditions. This flexible approach increases power, improves effect estimates and allows for more quantitative assessments of effect-size heterogeneity compared to simple shared or condition-specific assessments. We illustrate these features through an analysis of locally acting variants associated with gene expression (cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) in 44 human tissues. Our analysis identifies more eQTLs than existing approaches, consistent with improved power. We show that although genetic effects on expression are extensively shared among tissues, effect sizes can still vary greatly among tissues. Some shared eQTLs show stronger effects in subsets of biologically related tissues (for example, brain-related tissues), or in only one tissue (for example, testis). Our methods are widely applicable, computationally tractable for many conditions and available online.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Urbut","given":"Sarah M."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Gao"},{"family":"Carbonetto","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Stephens","given":"Matthew"}],"citation-key":"urbut2019","container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/s41588-018-0268-8","ISSN":"1546-1718","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,1]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Genomics;Statistics\nSubject_term_id: genomics;statistics","number":"1","page":"187-195","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Flexible statistical methods for estimating and testing effects in genomic studies with multiple conditions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0268-8","volume":"51"},

The consequences of polyploidization are complex and variable, and they differ greatly between systems (clonal or non-clonal) and species, but the process has often been considered to be an evolutionary ‘dead end’. Here, we review the accumulating evidence that correlates polyploidization with environmental change or stress, and that has led to an increased recognition of its short-term adaptive potential. In addition, we discuss how, once polyploidy has been established, the unique retention profile of duplicated genes following whole-genome duplication might explain key longer-term evolutionary transitions and a general increase in biological complexity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Van de Peer","given":"Yves"},{"family":"Mizrachi","given":"Eshchar"},{"family":"Marchal","given":"Kathleen"}],"citation-key":"vandepeer2017","container-title":"Nature Reviews Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Genet","DOI":"10.1038/nrg.2017.26","ISSN":"1471-0056, 1471-0064","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,7]]},"language":"en","page":"411-424","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The evolutionary significance of polyploidy","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.26","volume":"18"},
  {"id":"vanraden2008","abstract":"Efficient methods for processing genomic data were developed to increase reliability of estimated breeding values and to estimate thousands of marker effects simultaneously. Algorithms were derived and computer programs tested with simulated data for 2,967 bulls and 50,000 markers distributed randomly across 30 chromosomes. Estimation of genomic inbreeding coefficients required accurate estimates of allele frequencies in the base population. Linear model predictions of breeding values were computed by 3 equivalent methods: 1) iteration for individual allele effects followed by summation across loci to obtain estimated breeding values, 2) selection index including a genomic relationship matrix, and 3) mixed model equations including the inverse of genomic relationships. A blend of first- and second-order Jacobi iteration using 2 separate relaxation factors converged well for allele frequencies and effects. Reliability of predicted net merit for young bulls was 63% compared with 32% using the traditional relationship matrix. Nonlinear predictions were also computed using iteration on data and nonlinear regression on marker deviations; an additional (about 3%) gain in reliability for young bulls increased average reliability to 66%. Computing times increased linearly with number of genotypes. Estimation of allele frequencies required 2 processor days, and genomic predictions required <1 d per trait, and traits were processed in parallel. Information from genotyping was equivalent to about 20 daughters with phenotypic records. Actual gains may differ because the simulation did not account for linkage disequilibrium in the base population or selection in subsequent generations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"VanRaden","given":"P.

  {"id":"vanrheenen2021","abstract":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with a lifetime risk of one in 350 people and an unmet need for disease-modifying therapies. We conducted a cross-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) including 29,612 patients with ALS and 122,656 controls, which identified 15 risk loci. When combined with 8,953 individuals with whole-genome sequencing (6,538 patients, 2,415 controls) and a large cortex-derived expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) dataset (MetaBrain), analyses revealed locus-specific genetic architectures in which we prioritized genes either through rare variants, short tandem repeats or regulatory effects. ALS-associated risk loci were shared with multiple traits within the neurodegenerative spectrum but with distinct enrichment patterns across brain regions and cell types. Of the environmental and lifestyle risk factors obtained from the literature, Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a causal role for high cholesterol levels. The combination of all ALS-associated signals reveals a role for perturbations in vesicle-mediated transport and autophagy and provides evidence for cell-autonomous disease initiation in glutamatergic neurons.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Rheenen","given":"Wouter","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Spek","given":"Rick A.

So far, few chickpea (Cicer arietinum) germplasm accessions have been characterized at the genome sequence level2. Here we present a detailed map of variation in 3,171 cultivated and 195 wild accessions to provide publicly available resources for chickpea genomics research and breeding. We constructed a chickpea pan-genome to describe genomic diversity across cultivated chickpea and its wild progenitor accessions. A divergence tree using genes present in around 80% of individuals in one species allowed us to estimate the divergence of Cicer over the last 21 million years. Our analysis found chromosomal segments and genes that show signatures of selection during domestication, migration and improvement. The chromosomal locations of deleterious mutations responsible for limited genetic diversity and decreased fitness were identified in elite germplasm. We identified superior haplotypes for improvement-related traits in landraces that can be introgressed into elite breeding lines through haplotype-based breeding, and found targets for purging deleterious alleles through genomics-assisted breeding and/or gene editing. Finally, we propose three crop breeding strategies based on genomic prediction to enhance crop productivity for 16 traits while avoiding the erosion of genetic diversity through optimal contribution selection (OCS)-based pre-breeding.

  {"id":"vierstra2020","abstract":"Combinatorial binding of transcription factors to regulatory DNA underpins gene regulation in all organisms. Genetic variation in regulatory regions has been connected with diseases and diverse phenotypic traits1, but it remains challenging to distinguish variants that affect regulatory function2. Genomic DNase I footprinting enables the quantitative, nucleotide-resolution delineation of sites of transcription factor occupancy within native chromatin3–6. However, only a small fraction of such sites have been precisely resolved on the human genome sequence6. Here, to enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from 243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these data to delineate about 4.5 million compact genomic elements that encode transcription factor occupancy at nucleotide resolution. We map the fine-scale structure within about 1.6 million DNase I-hypersensitive sites and show that the overwhelming majority are populated by well-spaced sites of single transcription factor–DNA interaction. Cell-context-dependent cis-regulation is chiefly executed by wholesale modulation of accessibility at regulatory DNA rather than by differential transcription factor occupancy within accessible elements. We also show that the enrichment of genetic variants associated with diseases or phenotypic traits in regulatory regions1,7 is almost entirely attributable to variants within footprints, and that functional variants that affect transcription factor occupancy are nearly evenly partitioned between loss- and gain-of-function alleles. Unexpectedly, we find increased density of human genetic variation within transcription factor footprints, revealing an unappreciated driver of cis-regulatory evolution. Our results provide a framework for both global and nucleotide-precision analyses of gene regulatory mechanisms and functional genetic variation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Vierstra","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Lazar","given":"John"},{"family":"Sandstrom","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Halow","given":"Jessica"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Kristen"},{"family":"Bates","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Diegel","given":"Morgan"},{"family":"Dunn","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Neri","given":"Fidencio"},{"family":"Haugen","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Rynes","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Nelson","given":"Jemma"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Audra"},{"family":"Frerker","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Buckley","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Kaul","given":"Rajinder"},{"family":"Meuleman","given":"Wouter"},{"family":"Stamatoyannopoulos","given":"John A."}],"citation-key":"vierstra2020","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2528-x","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7818","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"language":"en","number":"7818","page":"729-736","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Global reference mapping of human transcription factor footprints","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2528-x","volume":"583"},

These studies were aimed at detecting variants at genomic loci that are associated with complex traits in the population and, in particular, at detecting associations between common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and common diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, auto-immune diseases, and psychiatric disorders. We start by giving a number of quotes from scientists and journalists about perceived problems with GWASs. We will then briefly give the history of GWASs and focus on the discoveries made through this experimental design, what those discoveries tell us and do not tell us about the genetics and biology of complex traits, and what immediate utility has come out of these studies. Rather than giving an exhaustive review of all reported findings for all diseases and other complex traits, we focus on the results for auto-immune diseases and metabolic diseases.

  {"id":"vosa2021","abstract":"Trait-associated genetic variants affect complex phenotypes primarily via regulatory mechanisms on the transcriptome. To investigate the genetics of gene expression, we performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through the eQTLGen Consortium. We detected cis-eQTL for 88% of genes, and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-eQTL (detected for 37% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested) showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication power and confounding by cell type composition. However, replication analyses in single-cell RNA-seq data prioritized intracellular trans-eQTL. Trans-eQTL exerted their effects via several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by transcription factors. Expression of 13% of the genes correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes, pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this work represents a large eQTL resource, and its results serve as a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex phenotypes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Võsa","given":"Urmo"},{"family":"Claringbould","given":"Annique"},{"family":"Westra","given":"Harm-Jan"},{"family":"Bonder","given":"Marc Jan"},{"family":"Deelen","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Biao"},{"family":"Kirsten","given":"Holger"},{"family":"Saha","given":"Ashis"},{"family":"Kreuzhuber","given":"Roman"},{"family":"Yazar","given":"Seyhan"},{"family":"Brugge","given":"Harm"},{"family":"Oelen","given":"Roy"},{"family":"Vries","given":"Dylan H.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Wijst","given":"Monique G.

In this Perspective, we explore properties of TWAS as a potential approach to prioritize causal genes at GWAS loci, by using simulations and case studies of literature-curated candidate causal genes for schizophrenia, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and Crohn’s disease. We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some likely to be non-causal, owing to sharing of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization with expression data from non-trait-related tissues or cell types, owing to substantial cross-cell-type variation in expression levels and eQTL strengths. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes more accurately than simple baselines. We suggest best practices for causal-gene prioritization with TWAS and discuss future opportunities for improvement. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using eQTL datasets to determine causal genes at GWAS loci.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Wainberg","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Sinnott-Armstrong","given":"Nasa"},{"family":"Mancuso","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Barbeira","given":"Alvaro N."},{"family":"Knowles","given":"David A."},{"family":"Golan","given":"David"},{"family":"Ermel","given":"Raili"},{"family":"Ruusalepp","given":"Arno"},{"family":"Quertermous","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Hao","given":"Ke"},{"family":"Björkegren","given":"Johan L.

We introduce Pilon, a fully automated, all-in-one tool for correcting draft assemblies and calling sequence variants of multiple sizes, including very large insertions and deletions. Pilon works with many types of sequence data, but is particularly strong when supplied with paired end data from two Illumina libraries with small e.g., 180 bp and large e.g., 3–5 Kb inserts. Pilon significantly improves draft genome assemblies by correcting bases, fixing mis-assemblies and filling gaps. For both haploid and diploid genomes, Pilon produces more contiguous genomes with fewer errors, enabling identification of more biologically relevant genes. Furthermore, Pilon identifies small variants with high accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art tools and is unique in its ability to accurately identify large sequence variants including duplications and resolve large insertions. Pilon is being used to improve the assemblies of thousands of new genomes and to identify variants from thousands of clinically relevant bacterial strains. Pilon is freely available as open source software.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"Bruce J."},{"family":"Abeel","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Shea","given":"Terrance"},{"family":"Priest","given":"Margaret"},{"family":"Abouelliel","given":"Amr"},{"family":"Sakthikumar","given":"Sharadha"},{"family":"Cuomo","given":"Christina A."},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Qiandong"},{"family":"Wortman","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Young","given":"Sarah K."},{"family":"Earl","given":"Ashlee M."}],"citation-key":"walker2014","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0112963","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"11","issued":{"literal":"2014年11月19日"},"language":"en","page":"e112963","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Pilon: An Integrated Tool for Comprehensive Microbial Variant Detection and Genome Assembly Improvement","title-short":"Pilon","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0112963","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"walkowiak2020","abstract":"Advances in genomics have expedited the improvement of several agriculturally important crops but similar efforts in wheat (Triticum spp.) have been more challenging. This is largely owing to the size and complexity of the wheat genome1, and the lack of genome-assembly data for multiple wheat lines2,3. Here we generated ten chromosome pseudomolecule and five scaffold assemblies of hexaploid wheat to explore the genomic diversity among wheat lines from global breeding programs. Comparative analysis revealed extensive structural rearrangements, introgressions from wild relatives and differences in gene content resulting from complex breeding histories aimed at improving adaptation to diverse environments, grain yield and quality, and resistance to stresses4,5. We provide examples outlining the utility of these genomes, including a detailed multi-genome-derived nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein repertoire involved in disease resistance and the characterization of Sm16, a gene associated with insect resistance. These genome assemblies will provide a basis for functional gene discovery and breeding to deliver the next generation of modern wheat cultivars.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Walkowiak","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Liangliang"},{"family":"Monat","given":"Cecile"},{"family":"Haberer","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Kassa","given":"Mulualem T."},{"family":"Brinton","given":"Jemima"},{"family":"Ramirez-Gonzalez","given":"Ricardo H."},{"family":"Kolodziej","given":"Markus C."},{"family":"Delorean","given":"Emily"},{"family":"Thambugala","given":"Dinushika"},{"family":"Klymiuk","given":"Valentyna"},{"family":"Byrns","given":"Brook"},{"family":"Gundlach","given":"Heidrun"},{"family":"Bandi","given":"Venkat"},{"family":"Siri","given":"Jorge Nunez"},{"family":"Nilsen","given":"Kirby"},{"family":"Aquino","given":"Catharine"},{"family":"Himmelbach","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Copetti","given":"Dario"},{"family":"Ban","given":"Tomohiro"},{"family":"Venturini","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Bevan","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Clavijo","given":"Bernardo"},{"family":"Koo","given":"Dal-Hoe"},{"family":"Ens","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Wiebe","given":"Krystalee"},{"family":"N’Diaye","given":"Amidou"},{"family":"Fritz","given":"Allen K."},{"family":"Gutwin","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Fiebig","given":"Anne"},{"family":"Fosker","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Bin Xiao"},{"family":"Accinelli","given":"Gonzalo Garcia"},{"family":"Gardner","given":"Keith A."},{"family":"Fradgley","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Gutierrez-Gonzalez","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Halstead-Nussloch","given":"Gwyneth"},{"family":"Hatakeyama","given":"Masaomi"},{"family":"Koh","given":"Chu Shin"},{"family":"Deek","given":"Jasline"},{"family":"Costamagna","given":"Alejandro C."},{"family":"Fobert","given":"Pierre"},{"family":"Heavens","given":"Darren"},{"family":"Kanamori","given":"Hiroyuki"},{"family":"Kawaura","given":"Kanako"},{"family":"Kobayashi","given":"Fuminori"},{"family":"Krasileva","given":"Ksenia"},{"family":"Kuo","given":"Tony"},{"family":"McKenzie","given":"Neil"},{"family":"Murata","given":"Kazuki"},{"family":"Nabeka","given":"Yusuke"},{"family":"Paape","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Padmarasu","given":"Sudharsan"},{"family":"Percival-Alwyn","given":"Lawrence"},{"family":"Kagale","given":"Sateesh"},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Uwe"},{"family":"Sese","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Juliana","given":"Philomin"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Ravi"},{"family":"Shimizu-Inatsugi","given":"Rie"},{"family":"Swarbreck","given":"David"},{"family":"Cockram","given":"James"},{"family":"Budak","given":"Hikmet"},{"family":"Tameshige","given":"Toshiaki"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Tsuyoshi"},{"family":"Tsuji","given":"Hiroyuki"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jianzhong"},{"family":"Steuernagel","given":"Burkhard"},{"family":"Small","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Cloutier","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Keeble-Gagnère","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Muehlbauer","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Tibbets","given":"Josquin"},{"family":"Nasuda","given":"Shuhei"},{"family":"Melonek","given":"Joanna"},{"family":"Hucl","given":"Pierre J."},{"family":"Sharpe","given":"Andrew G."},{"family":"Clark","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Legg","given":"Erik"},{"family":"Bharti","given":"Arvind"},{"family":"Langridge","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Hall","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Uauy","given":"Cristobal"},{"family":"Mascher","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Krattinger","given":"Simon G."},{"family":"Handa","given":"Hirokazu"},{"family":"Shimizu","given":"Kentaro K."},{"family":"Distelfeld","given":"Assaf"},{"family":"Chalmers","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Beat"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Klaus F.

  {"id":"wallace2020","abstract":"Horizontal integration of summary statistics from different GWAS traits can be used to evaluate evidence for their shared genetic causality. One popular method to do this is a Bayesian method, coloc, which is attractive in requiring only GWAS summary statistics and no linkage disequilibrium estimates and is now being used routinely to perform thousands of comparisons between traits. Here we show that while most users do not adjust default software values, misspecification of prior parameters can substantially alter posterior inference. We suggest data driven methods to derive sensible prior values, and demonstrate how sensitivity analysis can be used to assess robustness of posterior inference. The flexibility of coloc comes at the expense of an unrealistic assumption of a single causal variant per trait. This assumption can be relaxed by stepwise conditioning, but this requires external software and an LD matrix aligned to study alleles. We have now implemented conditioning within coloc, and propose a new alternative method, masking, that does not require LD and approximates conditioning when causal variants are independent. Importantly, masking can be used in combination with conditioning where allelically aligned LD estimates are available for only a single trait. We have implemented these developments in a new version of coloc which we hope will enable more informed choice of priors and overcome the restriction of the single causal variant assumptions in coloc analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Wallace","given":"Chris"}],"citation-key":"wallace2020","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1008720","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,20]]},"language":"en","page":"e1008720","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Eliciting priors and relaxing the single causal variant assumption in colocalisation analyses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008720","volume":"16"},

It has also become standard to ask whether different traits share the same causal variants, but one of the popular methods to answer this question, coloc, makes the simplifying assumption that only a single causal variant exists for any given trait in any genomic region. Here, we examine the potential of the recently proposed Sum of Single Effects (SuSiE) regression framework, which can be used for fine-mapping genetic signals, for use with coloc. SuSiE is a novel approach that allows evidence for association at multiple causal variants to be evaluated simultaneously, whilst separating the statistical support for each variant conditional on the causal signal being considered. We show this results in more accurate coloc inference than other proposals to adapt coloc for multiple causal variants based on conditioning. We therefore recommend that coloc be used in combination with SuSiE to optimise accuracy of colocalisation analyses when multiple causal variants exist.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wallace","given":"Chris"}],"citation-key":"wallace2021a","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1009440","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]]},"language":"en","page":"e1009440","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"A more accurate method for colocalisation analysis allowing for multiple causal variants","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009440","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"wang2009","abstract":"Rapid increase in the availability of fine-scale genetic marker maps has led to the intensive use of QTL mapping in the genetic study of quantitative traits. Composite interval mapping (CIM) is one of the most commonly used methods for QTL mapping with populations derived from biparental crosses. However, the algorithm used in CIM cannot completely ensure that the effect of QTL at current testing interval is not absorbed by the background marker variables, and may result in biased estimation of QTL effect. We proposed a statistical method for QTL mapping, which was called inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM). Two steps were included in ICIM. In the first step, stepwise regression was applied to identify the most significant regression variables. In the second step, a one-dimensional scanning or interval mapping was conducted for detecting additive (and dominance) QTL and a two-dimensional scanning was conducted for detecting digenic epistasis. ICIM provides intuitive statistics for testing additive, dominance and epistasis, and can be used for most experimental populations derived from two inbred parental lines. The EM algorithm used in ICIM has a fast convergence speed and is therefore less computing intensive. ICIM retains all advantages of CIM over interval mapping, and avoids the possible increase of sampling variance and the complicated background marker selection process in CIM. A doubled haploid (DH) population in barley was used to demonstrate the application of ICIM in mapping additive QTL and additive by additive interacting QTL.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jian-Kang"}],"citation-key":"wang2009","container-title":"ACTA AGRONOMICA SINICA","container-title-short":"A A S","DOI":"10.3724/SP.J.1006.2009.00239","ISSN":"0496-3490","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,5,6]]},"language":"zh","page":"239-245","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Inclusive Composite Interval Mapping of Quantitative Trait Genes: Inclusive Composite Interval Mapping of Quantitative Trait Genes","title-short":"Inclusive Composite Interval Mapping of Quantitative Trait Genes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://pub.chinasciencejournal.com/article/getArticleRedirect.action?doiCode=10.3724/SP.J.1006.2009.00239","volume":"35"},

  {"id":"wang2016","abstract":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used in genetic dissection of complex traits. However, common methods are all based on a fixed-SNP-effect mixed linear model (MLM) and single marker analysis, such as efficient mixed model analysis (EMMA). These methods require Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, which often is too conservative when the number of markers is extremely large. To address this concern, we proposed a random-SNP-effect MLM (RMLM) and a multi-locus RMLM (MRMLM) for GWAS. The RMLM simply treats the SNP-effect as random, but it allows a modified Bonferroni correction to be used to calculate the threshold p value for significance tests. The MRMLM is a multi-locus model including markers selected from the RMLM method with a less stringent selection criterion. Due to the multi-locus nature, no multiple test correction is needed. Simulation studies show that the MRMLM is more powerful in QTN detection and more accurate in QTN effect estimation than the RMLM, which in turn is more powerful and accurate than the EMMA. To demonstrate the new methods, we analyzed six flowering time related traits in Arabidopsis thaliana and detected more genes than previous reported using the EMMA. Therefore, the MRMLM provides an alternative for multi-locus GWAS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Shi-Bo"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Jian-Ying"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Wen-Long"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Yang-Jun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jin"},{"family":"Dunwell","given":"Jim M."},{"family":"Xu","given":"Shizhong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yuan-Ming"}],"citation-key":"wang2016","container-title":"Scientific Reports","DOI":"10.1038/srep19444","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,1,20]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"19444","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Improving power and accuracy of genome-wide association studies via a multi-locus mixed linear model methodology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19444","volume":"6"},

Global analyses of DNase I–hypersensitive sites and 3D genome architecture, linking functional variants to gene transcription, demonstrate the effects of domestication on cis-regulatory divergence. This study provides new insights into the evolution of gene organization, regulation and adaptation in a major crop, and should serve as a rich resource for genome-based cotton improvement.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Maojun"},{"family":"Tu","given":"Lili"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Min"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Zhongxu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Pengcheng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Qingyong"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Zhengxiu"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jianying"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xiaolin"},{"family":"Nie","given":"Xinhui"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhonghua"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yizan"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Cong"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Shuangxia"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Longfu"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiyan"},{"family":"Min","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Daojun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Lindsey","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xianlong"}],"citation-key":"wang2017a","container-title":"Nature Genetics","container-title-short":"Nat Genet","DOI":"10.1038/ng.3807","ISSN":"1061-4036, 1546-1718","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,4]]},"language":"en","page":"579-587","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Asymmetric subgenome selection and cis-regulatory divergence during cotton domestication","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3807","volume":"49"},

Thus, both pathogen defense and crop yield can be sustained.\nScience, this issue p. 1026; see also p. 976\nPlant immunity often penalizes growth and yield. The transcription factor Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1) reduces unproductive tillers and increases grains per panicle, which results in improved rice yield. Here we report that higher IPA1 levels enhance immunity. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of IPA1 at amino acid Ser163 within its DNA binding domain occurs in response to infection by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae and alters the DNA binding specificity of IPA1. Phosphorylated IPA1 binds to the promoter of the pathogen defense gene WRKY45 and activates its expression, leading to enhanced disease resistance. IPA1 returns to a nonphosphorylated state within 48 hours after infection, resuming support of the growth needed for high yield. Thus, IPA1 promotes both yield and disease resistance by sustaining a balance between growth and immunity.\nA transcription factor that builds a high-yielding rice plant also supports immune responses.\nA transcription factor that builds a high-yielding rice plant also supports immune responses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Lian"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Chern","given":"Mawsheng"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Hong"},{"family":"He","given":"Min"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Junjie"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xiaobo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Weitao"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jiali"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jichun"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiaoqiong"},{"family":"Qing","given":"Hai"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuping"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Guifu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wenming"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xianjun"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Lihuang"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Jian-Min"},{"family":"Ronald","given":"Pamela C."},{"family":"Li","given":"Shigui"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiayang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xuewei"}],"citation-key":"wang2018b","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aat7675","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6406","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,9,7]]},"language":"en","page":"1026-1028","PMID":"30190406","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Report","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"A single transcription factor promotes both yield and immunity in rice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6406/1026","volume":"361"},
  {"id":"wang2018c","abstract":"Gene expression regulation plays an important role in controlling plant phenotypes and adaptation. Here, we report a comprehensive assessment of gene expression variation through the transcriptome analyses of a large maize-teosinte experimental population. Genome-wide mapping identiﬁed 25 660 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for 17 311 genes, capturing an unprecedented range of expression variation. We found that local eQTL were more frequently mapped to adjacent genes, displaying a mode of expression piggybacking, which consequently created co-regulated gene clusters. Genes within the co-regulated gene clusters tend to have relevant functions and shared chromatin modiﬁcations. Distant eQTL formed 125 signiﬁcant distant eQTL hotspots with their targets signiﬁcantly enriched in speciﬁc functional categories. By integrating different sources of information, we identiﬁed putative trans- regulators for a variety of metabolic pathways. We demonstrated that the bHLH transcription factor R1 and hexokinase HEX9 might act as crucial regulators for ﬂavonoid biosynthesis and glycolysis, respectively. Moreover, we showed that domestication or improvement has signiﬁcantly affected global gene expression, with many genes targeted by selection. Of particular interest, the Bx genes for benzoxazinoid biosynthesis may have undergone coordinated cis-regulatory divergence between maize and teosinte, and a transposon insertion that inactivates Bx12 was under strong selection as maize spread into temperate environments with a distinct herbivore community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Xufeng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Qiuyue"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yaoyao"},{"family":"Lemmon","given":"Zachary H."},{"family":"Xu","given":"Guanghui"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yameng"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Dingyi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Doebley","given":"John F."},{"family":"Tian","given":"Feng"}],"citation-key":"wang2018c","container-title":"Molecular Plant","container-title-short":"Molecular Plant","DOI":"10.1016/j.molp.2017.12.011","ISSN":"16742052","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,3]]},"language":"en","page":"443-459","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Genome-wide Analysis of Transcriptional Variability in a Large Maize-Teosinte Population","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1674205217303817","volume":"11"},

To overcome this issue and improve prediction accuracy, many models and algorithms, including GBLUP, Bayes, and machine learning have been employed for GS. As hot issues in GS research, the estimation of non-additive genetic effects and the combined analysis of multiple traits or multiple environments are also important for improving the accuracy of prediction.

However, only a small percentage of patients show response to ICI, and there is an unmet need for biomarkers that will identify patients who are more likely to respond to immunotherapy. The fundamental basis for ICI response is the immunogenicity of a tumor, which is primarily determined by tumor antigenicity and antigen presentation efficiency. Here, we propose a method to measure tumor immunogenicity score (TIGS), which combines tumor mutational burden (TMB) and an expression signature of the antigen processing and presenting machinery (APM). In both correlation with pan-cancer ICI objective response rates (ORR) and ICI clinical response prediction for individual patients, TIGS consistently showed improved performance compared to TMB and other known prediction biomarkers for ICI response.

  {"id":"wang2020c","abstract":"In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) is required for the formation of transposable element (TE)-derived small RNA transcripts. These transcripts are processed by DICER-LIKE3 into 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide RNA-directed DNA methylation. In the pollen grain, Pol IV is also required for the accumulation of 21/22-nucleotide epigenetically activated siRNAs, which likely silence TEs via post-transcriptional mechanisms. Despite this proposed role of Pol IV, its loss of function in Arabidopsis does not cause a discernible pollen defect. Here, we show that the knockout of NRPD1, encoding the largest subunit of Pol IV, in the Brassicaceae species Capsella (Capsella rubella), caused postmeiotic arrest of pollen development at the microspore stage. As in Arabidopsis, all TE-derived siRNAs were depleted in Capsella nrpd1 microspores. In the wild-type background, the same TEs produced 21/22-nucleotide and 24-nucleotide siRNAs; these processes required Pol IV activity. Arrest of Capsella nrpd1 microspores was accompanied by the deregulation of genes targeted by Pol IV-dependent siRNAs. TEs were much closer to genes in Capsella compared with Arabidopsis, perhaps explaining the essential role of Pol IV in pollen development in Capsella.

In Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, the proteins DWARF14 (D14), MORE AXILLARY GROWTH 2 (MAX2), SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2-LIKE 6, 7 and 8 (SMXL6, SMXL7 and SMXL8) and their orthologues form a complex upon strigolactone perception and play a central part in strigolactone signalling5–10. However, whether and how strigolactones activate downstream transcription remains largely unknown. Here we use a synthetic strigolactone to identify 401 strigolactone-responsive genes in Arabidopsis, and show that these plant hormones regulate shoot branching, leaf shape and anthocyanin accumulation mainly through transcriptional activation of the BRANCHED 1, TCP DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 and PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT 1 genes. We find that SMXL6 targets 729 genes in the Arabidopsis genome and represses the transcription of SMXL6, SMXL7 and SMXL8 by binding directly to their promoters, showing that SMXL6 serves as an autoregulated transcription factor to maintain the homeostasis of strigolactone signalling. These findings reveal an unanticipated mechanism through which a transcriptional repressor of hormone signalling can directly recognize DNA and regulate transcription in higher plants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Hongyan"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Kou","given":"Liquan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Anqi"},{"family":"Shao","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Haiyan"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Guosheng"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaoqiang"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Jinfang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiayang"}],"citation-key":"wang2020d","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-020-2382-x","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7815","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Plant signalling;Strigolactone\nSubject_term_id: plant-signalling;strigolactone","number":"7815","page":"277-281","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Transcriptional regulation of strigolactone signalling in Arabidopsis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2382-x","volume":"583"},

To explore the genomic basis underlying the dramatic yield increase in maize, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genomic and phenotypic changes associated with modern maize breeding through chronological sampling of 350 elite inbred lines representing multiple eras of germplasm from both China and the United States. We document several convergent phenotypic changes in both countries. Using genome-wide association and selection scan methods, we identify 160 loci underlying adaptive agronomic phenotypes and more than 1,800 genomic regions representing the targets of selection during modern breeding.

The three-dimensional structure of the genome is intricately linked to gene expression, but its role in transcription regulation following polyploidy and domestication remains unclear. Here, we generated high-resolution (∼2 kb) Hi-C maps for cultivated soybean (Glycine max), wild soybean (Glycine soja) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). We found polyploidization in soybean may induce architecture changes of topologically associating domains and subsequent diploidization led to chromatin topology alteration around chromosome-rearrangement sites. Compared with single-copy and small-scale duplicated genes, WGD genes displayed more long-range chromosomal interactions and were coupled with higher levels of gene expression and chromatin accessibilities but void of DNA methylation. Interestingly, chromatin loop reorganization was involved in expression divergence of the genes during soybean domestication. Genes with chromatin loops were under stronger artificial selection than genes without loops. These findings provide insights into roles of dynamic chromatin structures on gene expression during polyploidization, diploidization and domestication of soybean.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Longfei"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Guanghong"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Xinyu"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Z.

Here, we report reference-grade genome assemblies for three species of cotton ranging three-fold in genome size, namely Gossypium rotundifolium (K2), G. arboreum (A2), and G. raimondii (D5), using Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Comparative genome analyses document the details of lineage-specific TE amplification contributing to the large genome size differences (K2, 2.44 Gb; A2, 1.62 Gb; D5, 750.19 Mb), and indicate relatively conserved gene content and synteny relationships among genomes. We found that approximately 17% of syntenic genes exhibit chromatin status change between active (“A”) and inactive (“B”) compartments, and TE amplification was associated with the increase of the proportion of A compartment in gene regions (∼ 7,000 genes) in K2 and A2 relative to D5. Only 42% of topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries were conserved among the three genomes. Our data implicate recent amplification of TEs following formation of lineage-specific TAD boundaries.

In Arabidopsis, loss of function of NRPD1, encoding the largest subunit of the plant-specific RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), can suppress the triploid block. Pol IV generates short RNAs required to guide de novo methylation in the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. Recent work suggests that suppression of the triploid block by mutants in RdDM components differs, depending on whether the diploid pollen is derived from tetraploid plants or from the omission in second division 1 (osd1) mutant.

  {"id":"wang2021d","abstract":"With the increasing availability of biobank-scale datasets that incorporate both genomic data and electronic health records, many associations between genetic variants and phenotypes of interest have been discovered. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), which are being widely explored in precision medicine, use the results of association studies to predict the genetic component of disease risk by accumulating risk alleles weighted by their effect sizes. However, limited studies have thoroughly investigated best practices for PRS in global populations across different diseases. In this study, we utilize data from the Global-Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI), which consists of individuals from diverse ancestries and across continents, to explore methodological considerations and PRS prediction performance in 9 different biobanks for 14 disease endpoints. Specifically, we constructed PRS using heuristic (pruning and thresholding, P+T) and Bayesian (PRS-CS) methods. We found that the genetic architecture, such as SNP-based heritability and polygenicity, varied greatly among endpoints. For both PRS construction methods, using a European ancestry LD reference panel resulted in comparable or higher prediction accuracy compared to several other non-European based panels; this is largely attributable to European descent populations still comprising the majority of GBMI participants. PRS-CS overall outperformed the classic P+T method, especially for endpoints with higher SNP-based heritability. For example, substantial improvements are observed in East-Asian ancestry (EAS) using PRS-CS compared to P+T for heart failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Notably, prediction accuracy is heterogeneous across endpoints, biobanks, and ancestries, especially for asthma which has known variation in disease prevalence across global populations. Overall, we provide lessons for PRS construction, evaluation, and interpretation using the GBMI and highlight the importance of best practices for PRS in the biobank-scale genomics era.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Namba","given":"Shinichi"},{"family":"Lopera","given":"Esteban"},{"family":"Kerminen","given":"Sini"},{"family":"Tsuo","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Läll","given":"Kristi"},{"family":"Kanai","given":"Masahiro"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Kuan-Han"},{"family":"Favé","given":"Marie-Julie"},{"family":"Bhatta","given":"Laxmi"},{"family":"Awadalla","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Brumpton","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Deelen","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Hveem","given":"Kristian"},{"family":"Faro","given":"Valeria Lo"},{"family":"Mägi","given":"Reedik"},{"family":"Murakami","given":"Yoshinori"},{"family":"Sanna","given":"Serena"},{"family":"Smoller","given":"Jordan W."},{"family":"Uzunovic","given":"Jasmina"},{"family":"Wolford","given":"Brooke N."},{"family":"Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative","given":"Cristen Willer"},{"family":"Gamazon","given":"Eric R."},{"family":"Cox","given":"Nancy J."},{"family":"Surakka","given":"Ida"},{"family":"Okada","given":"Yukinori"},{"family":"Martin","given":"Alicia R."},{"family":"Hirbo","given":"Jibril"}],"citation-key":"wang2021d","DOI":"10.1101/2021.11.18.21266545","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,2]]},"language":"en","page":"2021.11.18.21266545","publisher":"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press","source":"medRxiv","title":"Global biobank analyses provide lessons for computing polygenic risk scores across diverse cohorts","type":"article","URL":"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.18.21266545v2"},
  {"id":"wang2021e","abstract":"Genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic prediction/selection (GP/GS) are the two essential enterprises in genomic research. Due to the great magnitude and complexity of genomic and phenotypic data, analytical methods and their associated software packages are frequently advanced. GAPIT is a widely-used genomic association and prediction integrated tool as an R package. The first version was released to the public in 2012 with the implementation of the general linear model (GLM), mixed linear model (MLM), compressed MLM (CMLM), and genomic best linear unbiased prediction (gBLUP). The second version was released in 2016 with several new implementations, including enriched CMLM (ECMLM) and settlement of MLMs under progressively exclusive relationship (SUPER). All the GWAS methods are based on the single-locus test. For the first time, in the current release of GAPIT, version 3 implemented three multi-locus test methods, including multiple loci mixed model (MLMM), fixed and random model circulating probability unification (FarmCPU), and Bayesian-information and linkage-disequilibrium iteratively nested keyway (BLINK). Additionally, two GP/GS methods were implemented based on CMLM (named compressed BLUP; cBLUP) and SUPER (named SUPER BLUP; sBLUP). These new implementations not only boost statistical power for GWAS and prediction accuracy for GP/GS, but also improve computing speed and increase the capacity to analyze big genomic data. Here, we document the current upgrade of GAPIT by describing the selection of the recently developed methods, their implementations, and potential impact.

We de novo assembled three high-quality genomes of Tibetan Prunus species. A comparative analysis of Prunus genomes indicated a remarkable expansion of the SINE retrotransposons occurred in the genomes of Tibetan species. We observed genetic differentiation between Tibetan peaches from high and low altitudes and that genes associated with light stress signaling, especially UV stress signaling, were enriched in the differentiated regions. By profiling the metabolomes of Tibetan peach fruit, we determined 379 metabolites had significant genetic correlations with altitudes and that in particular phenylpropanoids were positively correlated with altitudes. We identified 62 Tibetan peach-specific SINEs that colocalized with metabolites differentially accumualted in Tibetan relative to cultivated peach. We demonstrated that two SINEs were inserted in a locus controlling the accumulation of 3-O-feruloyl quinic acid. SINE1 was specific to Tibetan peach. SINE2 was predominant in high altitudes and associated with the accumulation of 3-O-feruloyl quinic acid. These genomic and metabolic data for Prunus populations native to the Himalayan region indicate that the expansion of SINE retrotransposons helped Tibetan Prunus species adapt to the harsh environment of the Himalayan plateau by promoting the accumulation of beneficial metabolites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Xia"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shengjun"},{"family":"Zuo","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Weikang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shanshan"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Pingcuo","given":"Gesang"},{"family":"Ying","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Fan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yuanrong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Junwei"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Ting-Shuang"},{"family":"Zan","given":"Yanjun"},{"family":"Larkin","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Deng","given":"Xiuxin"},{"family":"Zeng","given":"Xiuli"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Qiang"}],"citation-key":"wang2021h","container-title":"Current Biology","container-title-short":"Current Biology","DOI":"10.1016/j.cub.2021.06.062","ISSN":"0960-9822","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,13]]},"language":"en","page":"3848-3860.e8","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Genomic basis of high-altitude adaptation in Tibetan Prunus fruit trees","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982221008915","volume":"31"},

A total of 25 sQTLs and 14 hQTLs related to cotton fiber quality were identified, of which 26 were novel QTLs. Two major QTLs detected by both GWAS methods were responsible for fiber strength and length.

The current availability of hundreds of GWASs provides a unique opportunity to address these questions. We systematically analyzed 4,155 publicly available GWASs. For a subset of well-powered GWASs on 558 traits, we provide an extensive overview of pleiotropy and genetic architecture. We show that trait-associated loci cover more than half of the genome, and 90% of these overlap with loci from multiple traits. We find that potential causal variants are enriched in coding and flanking regions, as well as in regulatory elements, and show variation in polygenicity and discoverability of traits.

  {"id":"wen2016","abstract":"Mapping molecular QTLs has emerged as an important tool for understanding the genetic basis of cell functions. With the increasing availability of functional genomic data, it is natural to incorporate genomic annotations into QTL discovery. Discovering molecular QTLs is typically framed as a multiple hypothesis testing problem and solved using false discovery rate (FDR) control procedures. Currently, most existing statistical approaches rely on obtaining $p$-values for each candidate locus through permutation-based schemes, which are not only inconvenient for incorporating highly informative genomic annotations but also computationally inefficient. In this paper, we discuss a novel statistical approach for integrative QTL discovery based on the theoretical framework of Bayesian FDR control. We use a Bayesian hierarchical model to naturally integrate genomic annotations into molecular QTL mapping and propose an empirical Bayes-based computational procedure to approximate the necessary posterior probabilities to achieve high computational efficiency. Through theoretical arguments and simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed approach rigorously controls the desired type I error rate and greatly improves the power of QTL discovery when incorporating informative annotations. Finally, we demonstrate our approach by analyzing the expression-genotype data from 44 human tissues generated by the GTEx project. By integrating the simple annotation of SNP distance to transcription start sites, we discover more genes that harbor expression-associated SNPs in all 44 tissues, with an average increase of 1485 genes per tissue.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wen","given":"Xiaoquan"}],"citation-key":"wen2016","container-title":"The Annals of Applied Statistics","DOI":"10.1214/16-AOAS952","ISSN":"1932-6157, 1941-7330","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,9]]},"page":"1619-1638","publisher":"Institute of Mathematical Statistics","source":"Project Euclid","title":"Molecular QTL discovery incorporating genomic annotations using Bayesian false discovery rate control","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-10/issue-3/Molecular-QTL-discovery-incorporating-genomic-annotations-using-Bayesian-false-discovery/10.1214/16-AOAS952.full","volume":"10"},

We introduce a natural Bayesian hierarchical model that treats the latent association status of molecular QTLs as SNP-level annotations for candidate SNPs of complex traits. We detail a computational procedure to seamlessly perform enrichment, fine-mapping and colocalization analyses, which is a distinct feature compared to the existing colocalization analysis procedures in the literature. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and requires only summary-level statistics. We evaluate and demonstrate the proposed computational approach through extensive simulation studies and analyses of blood lipid data and the whole blood eQTL data from the GTEx project. In addition, a useful utility from our proposed method enables the computation of expected colocalization signals using simple characteristics of the association data. Using this utility, we further illustrate the importance of enrichment analysis on the ability to discover colocalized signals and the potential limitations of currently available molecular QTL data.

Despite intensive study, the identity of the parental diploids and the antiquity of polyploidization remain unresolved. In this study, variation in the maternally inherited chloroplast genome was assessed among species representing both of the parental genomes and the tetraploids. Approximately 560 restriction sites were assayed in each accession, representing sequence information for about 3200 nucleotides. The resulting maternal phylogeny has no convergent restriction site mutations and demonstrates that the cytoplasm donor for all tetraploid species was an A genome diploid with a chloroplast genome that is similar to Gossypium arboreum and Gossypium herbaceum. No mutational differences were detected between these two species, and few mutations distinguish the chloroplast genomes of A genome diploids from those of tetraploid taxa. In contrast to expectations based on extensive taxonomic, geographic, and genetic diversity, a surprisingly low level of sequence divergence has accumulated subsequent to polyploidization. Chloroplast genomes of tetraploid species are distinguished from each other by between one and six apparent point mutations. The data suggest that tetraploid cotton originated relatively recently, perhaps within the last 1-2 million years, with subsequent rapid evolution and diversification throughout the New World tropics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Wendel","given":"J.

We present an overview of the taxonomy of Gossypium L. (the cotton genus) and its evolutionary history. Gossypium contains more than 50 recognized species, including several recently described, distributed in arid to semiarid regions of the tropics and subtropics. Diversity in Gossypium has been promoted by two seemingly unlikely processes: transoceanic, long-distance dispersal and wide hybridization among lineages that presently are widely separated geographically. Included are four species that were independently domesticated for their seed fiber—two diploids from Africa–Asia and two allopolyploids from the Americas. This repeated domestication of different wild progenitors represents a remarkable case of human-driven parallel evolution. Morphological variation in Gossypium is extensive; growth forms in the genus range from sprawling herbaceous perennials to ?15-m-tall trees, representing a notable array of reproductive and vegetative characteristics. Equally impressive is the striking cytogenetic and genomic diversity that emerged as Gossypium diversified and spread worldwide, ultimately spawning eight groups of closely related diploid (n = 13) species (i.e., genome groups A through G, and K). DNA sequence data place the origin of Gossypium at about 5 to 10 million years ago (mya), which rapidly diversified into these major genome groups shortly thereafter. Allopolyploid cottons appeared within the last 1 to 2 million years, a consequence of the improbable transoceanic dispersal of an A genome taxon to the New World and subsequent hybridization with an indigenous D genome diploid. Diversification of the nascent allopolyploid gave rise to three modern lineages containing seven species, including the agronomically important G. hirsutum L. and G. barbadense L.","author":[{"family":"Wendel","given":"J."},{"family":"Grover","given":"C."}],"citation-key":"wendel2015","DOI":"10.2134/AGRONMONOGR57.2013.0020","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Taxonomy and Evolution of the Cotton Genus, Gossypium","type":"paper-conference"},

The genetic determinants of transcript-level variation were characterized in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (n = 211) of Arabidopsis thaliana using whole-genome microarray analysis and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping of transcript levels as expression traits (e-traits). Genetic control of transcription was highly complex: one-third of the quantitatively controlled transcripts/e-traits were regulated by cis-eQTL, and many trans-eQTL mapped to hotspots that regulated hundreds to thousands of e-traits. Several thousand eQTL of large phenotypic effect were detected, but almost all (93%) of the 36,871 eQTL were associated with small phenotypic effects (R2 < 0.3). Many transcripts/e-traits were controlled by multiple eQTL with opposite allelic effects and exhibited higher heritability in the RILs than their parents, suggesting nonadditive genetic variation. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale global eQTL study in a relatively large plant mapping population. It reveals that the genetic control of transcript level is highly variable and multifaceted and that this complexity may be a general characteristic of eukaryotes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"West","given":"Marilyn A.

Ramírez-González et al. exploited the fruits of this endeavor to identify tissue-specific biased gene expression and coexpression networks during development and exposure to stress. These resources will accelerate our understanding of the genetic basis of bread wheat.\nScience, this issue p. eaar7191; see also p. eaar6089\nStructured Abstract\nINTRODUCTIONWheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most widely cultivated crop on Earth, contributing about a fifth of the total calories consumed by humans. Consequently, wheat yields and production affect the global economy, and failed harvests can lead to social unrest. Breeders continuously strive to develop improved varieties by fine-tuning genetically complex yield and end-use quality parameters while maintaining stable yields and adapting the crop to regionally specific biotic and abiotic stresses.\nRATIONALEBreeding efforts are limited by insufficient knowledge and understanding of wheat biology and the molecular basis of central agronomic traits. To meet the demands of human population growth, there is an urgent need for wheat research and breeding to accelerate genetic gain as well as to increase and protect wheat yield and quality traits. In other plant and animal species, access to a fully annotated and ordered genome sequence, including regulatory sequences and genome-diversity information, has promoted the development of systematic and more time-efficient approaches for the selection and understanding of important traits. Wheat has lagged behind, primarily owing to the challenges of assembling a genome that is more than five times as large as the human genome, polyploid, and complex, containing more than 85% repetitive DNA. To provide a foundation for improvement through molecular breeding, in 2005, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium set out to deliver a high-quality annotated reference genome sequence of bread wheat.\nRESULTSAn annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in the form of 21 chromosome-like sequence assemblies has now been delivered, giving access to 107,891 high-confidence genes, including their genomic context of regulatory sequences. This assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage–related gene coexpression networks using a transcriptome atlas representing all stages of wheat development. The dynamics of change in complex gene families involved in environmental adaptation and end-use quality were revealed at subgenome resolution and contextualized to known agronomic single-gene or quantitative trait loci. Aspects of the future value of the annotated assembly for molecular breeding and research were exemplarily illustrated by resolving the genetic basis of a quantitative trait locus conferring resistance to abiotic stress and insect damage as well as by serving as the basis for genome editing of the flowering-time trait.\nCONCLUSIONThis annotated reference sequence of wheat is a resource that can now drive disruptive innovation in wheat improvement, as this community resource establishes the foundation for accelerating wheat research and application through improved understanding of wheat biology and genomics-assisted breeding. Importantly, the bioinformatics capacity developed for model-organism genomes will facilitate a better understanding of the wheat genome as a result of the high-quality chromosome-based genome assembly. By necessity, breeders work with the genome at the whole chromosome level, as each new cross involves the modification of genome-wide gene networks that control the expression of complex traits such as yield. With the annotated and ordered reference genome sequence in place, researchers and breeders can now easily access sequence-level information to precisely define the necessary changes in the genomes for breeding programs. This will be realized through the implementation of new DNA marker platforms and targeted breeding technologies, including genome editing. <img class=\"fragment-image\" aria-describedby=\"F1-caption\" src=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6403/eaar7191/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Wheat genome deciphered, assembled, and ordered.Seeds, or grains, are what counts with respect to wheat yields (left panel), but all parts of the plant contribute to crop performance. With complete access to the ordered sequence of all 21 wheat chromosomes, the context of regulatory sequences, and the interaction network of expressed genes—all shown here as a circular plot (right panel) with concentric tracks for diverse aspects of wheat genome composition—breeders and researchers now have the ability to rewrite the story of wheat crop improvement. Details on value ranges underlying the concentric heatmaps of the right panel are provided in the full article online.\nAn annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in 21 pseudomolecules has been analyzed to identify the distribution and genomic context of coding and noncoding elements across the A, B, and D subgenomes. With an estimated coverage of 94% of the genome and containing 107,891 high-confidence gene models, this assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage–related coexpression networks by providing a transcriptome atlas representing major stages of wheat development. Dynamics of complex gene families involved in environmental adaptation and end-use quality were revealed at subgenome resolution and contextualized to known agronomic single-gene or quantitative trait loci. This community resource establishes the foundation for accelerating wheat research and application through improved understanding of wheat biology and genomics-assisted breeding.\nThe 21 annotated chromosomes of bread wheat provide a foundation for innovation in research and breeding.\nThe 21 annotated chromosomes of bread wheat provide a foundation for innovation in research and breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Consortium (IWGSC)","given":"The International Wheat Genome Sequencing"},{"family":"Appels","given":"Rudi"},{"family":"Eversole","given":"Kellye"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Feuillet","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Beat"},{"family":"Rogers","given":"Jane"},{"family":"Pozniak","given":"Curtis J."},{"family":"Choulet","given":"Frédéric"},{"family":"Distelfeld","given":"Assaf"},{"family":"Poland","given":"Jesse"},{"family":"Ronen","given":"Gil"},{"family":"Sharpe","given":"Andrew G."},{"family":"Barad","given":"Omer"},{"family":"Baruch","given":"Kobi"},{"family":"Keeble-Gagnère","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Mascher","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Ben-Zvi","given":"Gil"},{"family":"Josselin","given":"Ambre-Aurore"},{"family":"Himmelbach","given":"Axel"},{"family":"Balfourier","given":"François"},{"family":"Gutierrez-Gonzalez","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Hayden","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Koh","given":"ChuShin"},{"family":"Muehlbauer","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Pasam","given":"Raj K."},{"family":"Paux","given":"Etienne"},{"family":"Rigault","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Tibbits","given":"Josquin"},{"family":"Tiwari","given":"Vijay"},{"family":"Spannagl","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Lang","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Gundlach","given":"Heidrun"},{"family":"Haberer","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Mayer","given":"Klaus F.

  {"id":"whiffin2020","abstract":"Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are tissue-specific cis-regulators of protein translation. Isolated reports have shown that variants that create or disrupt uORFs can cause disease. Here, in a systematic genome-wide study using 15,708 whole genome sequences, we show that variants that create new upstream start codons, and variants disrupting stop sites of existing uORFs, are under strong negative selection. This selection signal is significantly stronger for variants arising upstream of genes intolerant to loss-of-function variants. Furthermore, variants creating uORFs that overlap the coding sequence show signals of selection equivalent to coding missense variants. Finally, we identify specific genes where modification of uORFs likely represents an important disease mechanism, and report a novel uORF frameshift variant upstream of NF2 in neurofibromatosis. Our results highlight uORF-perturbing variants as an under-recognised functional class that contribute to penetrant human disease, and demonstrate the power of large-scale population sequencing data in studying non-coding variant classes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Whiffin","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Karczewski","given":"Konrad J."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaolei"},{"family":"Chothani","given":"Sonia"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Miriam J."},{"family":"Evans","given":"D.

So far, a major focus of BCI research has been on restoring gross motor skills, such as reaching and grasping1–5 or point-and-click typing with a computer cursor6,7. However, rapid sequences of highly dexterous behaviours, such as handwriting or touch typing, might enable faster rates of communication. Here we developed an intracortical BCI that decodes attempted handwriting movements from neural activity in the motor cortex and translates it to text in real time, using a recurrent neural network decoding approach. With this BCI, our study participant, whose hand was paralysed from spinal cord injury, achieved typing speeds of 90 characters per minute with 94.1% raw accuracy online, and greater than 99% accuracy offline with a general-purpose autocorrect. To our knowledge, these typing speeds exceed those reported for any other BCI, and are comparable to typical smartphone typing speeds of individuals in the age group of our participant (115 characters per minute)8. Finally, theoretical considerations explain why temporally complex movements, such as handwriting, may be fundamentally easier to decode than point-to-point movements. Our results open a new approach for BCIs and demonstrate the feasibility of accurately decoding rapid, dexterous movements years after paralysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Willett","given":"Francis R."},{"family":"Avansino","given":"Donald T."},{"family":"Hochberg","given":"Leigh R."},{"family":"Henderson","given":"Jaimie M."},{"family":"Shenoy","given":"Krishna V."}],"citation-key":"willett2021","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03506-2","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7858","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5]]},"language":"en","number":"7858","page":"249-254","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"High-performance brain-to-text communication via handwriting","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03506-2","volume":"593"},

The beneficial effects of these repopulating microglia are critically dependent on interleukin-6 (IL-6) trans-signaling via the soluble IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and robustly support adult neurogenesis, specifically by augmenting the survival of newborn neurons that directly support cognitive function. We conclude that microglia in the mammalian brain can be manipulated to adopt a neuroprotective and pro-regenerative phenotype that can aid repair and alleviate the cognitive deficits arising from brain injury.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Willis","given":"Emily F."},{"family":"MacDonald","given":"Kelli P.

However, the 3D organization of chromosomes during human brain development and its role in regulating gene networks dysregulated in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or schizophrenia4,5,6, are unknown. Here we generate high-resolution 3D maps of chromatin contacts during human corticogenesis, permitting large-scale annotation of previously uncharacterized regulatory relationships relevant to the evolution of human cognition and disease. Our analyses identify hundreds of genes that physically interact with enhancers gained on the human lineage, many of which are under purifying selection and associated with human cognitive function. We integrate chromatin contacts with non-coding variants identified in schizophrenia genome-wide association studies (GWAS), highlighting multiple candidate schizophrenia risk genes and pathways, including transcription factors involved in neurogenesis, and cholinergic signalling molecules, several of which are supported by independent expression quantitative trait loci and gene expression analyses. Genome editing in human neural progenitors suggests that one of these distal schizophrenia GWAS loci regulates FOXG1 expression, supporting its potential role as a schizophrenia risk gene. This work provides a framework for understanding the effect of non-coding regulatory elements on human brain development and the evolution of cognition, and highlights novel mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Won","given":"Hyejung"},{"family":"Torre-Ubieta","given":"Luis","non-dropping-particle":"de la"},{"family":"Stein","given":"Jason L."},{"family":"Parikshak","given":"Neelroop N."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Jerry"},{"family":"Opland","given":"Carli K."},{"family":"Gandal","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Sutton","given":"Gavin J."},{"family":"Hormozdiari","given":"Farhad"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Daning"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Changhoon"},{"family":"Eskin","given":"Eleazar"},{"family":"Voineagu","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Ernst","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Geschwind","given":"Daniel H."}],"citation-key":"won2016","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature19847","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7626","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10]]},"language":"en","number":"7626","page":"523-527","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Chromosome conformation elucidates regulatory relationships in developing human brain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19847","volume":"538"},

  {"id":"wu2021","abstract":"Grain number per panicle (GNP) is an important agronomic trait that contributes to rice grain yield. Despite its importance in rice breeding, the molecular mechanism underlying GNP regulation remains largely unknown. Here, we report that genetic variation in the CArG box-containing inverted repeat (IR) sequence of OsREM20 promoter alters its expression level and contributes to GNP variation among rice varieties through genetic analysis and transgenic validation. We revealed that the IR sequence regulates OsREM20 expression by affecting the direct binding of OsMADS34 to the CArG box within the IR sequence. The divergent pOsREM20IR and pOsREM20ΔIR alleles originated from different O. rufipogon accessions, and were independently inherited into the japonica and indica subspecies respectively during domestication. We further determined that IR sequence variations in the OsREM20 promoter can be utilized for germplasm improvement through either genome editing or traditional breeding. Our findings highlight exciting implications not only for characterizing the novel genetic variation that responsible for GNP diversity in rice, but also for revealing the molecular mechanism and potential application of the cis-regulatory element-containing IR sequence in the regulation of agronomically important gene expression.","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Xiaowei"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Hengbin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiyao"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Hua","given":"Lekai"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Yundong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ahong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaohui"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jiafan"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Meng","given":"Xiangbing"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Dahan"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Shaoyang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Xuehui"},{"family":"Han","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiayang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yonghong"}],"citation-key":"wu2021","container-title":"Molecular Plant","container-title-short":"Mol Plant","DOI":"10.1016/j.molp.2021.03.016","ISSN":"1752-9867","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,16]]},"language":"eng","PMID":"33741527","source":"PubMed","title":"Enhancing Rice Grain Production by Manipulating naturally Evolved cis-Regulatory Element-Containing Inverted Repeat Sequence of OsREM20","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"wu2021a","abstract":"Defects in DNA repair frequently lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, underscoring the particular importance of DNA repair in long-lived post-mitotic neurons1,2. The cellular genome is subjected to a constant barrage of endogenous DNA damage, but surprisingly little is known about the identity of the lesion(s) that accumulate in neurons and whether they accrue throughout the genome or at specific loci. Here we show that post-mitotic neurons accumulate unexpectedly high levels of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) at specific sites within the genome. Genome-wide mapping reveals that SSBs are located within enhancers at or near CpG dinucleotides and sites of DNA demethylation. These SSBs are repaired by PARP1 and XRCC1-dependent mechanisms. Notably, deficiencies in XRCC1-dependent short-patch repair increase DNA repair synthesis at neuronal enhancers, whereas defects in long-patch repair reduce synthesis. The high levels of SSB repair in neuronal enhancers are therefore likely to be sustained by both short-patch and long-patch processes. These data provide the first evidence of site- and cell-type-specific SSB repair, revealing unexpected levels of localized and continuous DNA breakage in neurons. In addition, they suggest an explanation for the neurodegenerative phenotypes that occur in patients with defective SSB repair.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Sarah E."},{"family":"Nathan","given":"William J."},{"family":"Paiano","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Callen","given":"Elsa"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Dongpeng"},{"family":"Shinoda","given":"Kenta"},{"family":"Wietmarschen","given":"Niek","non-dropping-particle":"van"},{"family":"Colón-Mercado","given":"Jennifer M."},{"family":"Zong","given":"Dali"},{"family":"De Pace","given":"Raffaella"},{"family":"Shih","given":"Han-Yu"},{"family":"Coon","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Parsadanian","given":"Maia"},{"family":"Pavani","given":"Raphael"},{"family":"Hanzlikova","given":"Hana"},{"family":"Park","given":"Solji"},{"family":"Jung","given":"Seol Kyoung"},{"family":"McHugh","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Canela","given":"Andres"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Chongyi"},{"family":"Casellas","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Caldecott","given":"Keith W."},{"family":"Ward","given":"Michael E."},{"family":"Nussenzweig","given":"André"}],"citation-key":"wu2021a","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-021-03468-5","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7859","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5]]},"language":"en","number":"7859","page":"440-444","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Neuronal enhancers are hotspots for DNA single-strand break repair","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03468-5","volume":"593"},

It is crucial for this type of tool to use the latest annotation databases for as many organisms as possible. To meet these requirements, we present here an updated version of our popular Bioconductor package, clusterProfiler 4.0. This package has been enhanced considerably compared with its original version published 9 years ago. The new version provides a universal interface for functional enrichment analysis in thousands of organisms based on internally supported ontologies and pathways as well as annotation data provided by users or derived from online databases. It also extends the dplyr and ggplot2 packages to offer tidy interfaces for data operation and visualization. Other new features include gene set enrichment analysis and comparison of enrichment results from multiple gene lists.

We used 10 different recombination inbred line (RIL) populations genotyped with high-density markers and phenotyped in multiple environments to dissect the genetic architecture of maize ear traits. Three methods were used to map the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting ear traits. We found 17–34 minor- or moderate-effect loci that influence ear traits, with little epistasis and environmental interactions, totally accounting for 55.4–82% of the phenotypic variation. Four novel QTLs were validated and fine mapped using candidate gene association analysis, expression QTL analysis and heterogeneous inbred family validation. The combination of multiple different populations is a flexible and manageable way to collaboratively integrate widely available genetic resources, thereby boosting the statistical power of QTL discovery for important traits in agricultural crops, ultimately facilitating breeding programs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Xiao","given":"Yingjie"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Xiaohong"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Shizhong"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Qingchun"},{"family":"Qiao","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Raihan","given":"Mohammad Sharif"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Haijun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xuehai"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ning"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaqing"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Min"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Minliang"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Lijun"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Nannan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Gengshen"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Ye"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Gen"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Weidong"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Debo"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Jianbing"}],"citation-key":"xiao2016","container-title":"New Phytologist","container-title-short":"New Phytol","DOI":"10.1111/nph.13814","ISSN":"1469-8137","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","page":"1095-1106","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Genome-wide dissection of the maize ear genetic architecture using multiple populations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nph.13814","volume":"210"},

This system uses a small guide RNA (gRNA) to direct Cas9 endonuclease to a specific DNA site; thus, its targeting capability is largely constrained by the gRNA-expressing device. In this study, we developed a general strategy to produce numerous gRNAs from a single polycistronic gene. The endogenous tRNA-processing system, which precisely cleaves both ends of the tRNA precursor, was engineered as a simple and robust platform to boost the targeting and multiplex editing capability of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We demonstrated that synthetic genes with tandemly arrayed tRNA–gRNA architecture were efficiently and precisely processed into gRNAs with desired 5′ targeting sequences in vivo, which directed Cas9 to edit multiple chromosomal targets. Using this strategy, multiplex genome editing and chromosomal-fragment deletion were readily achieved in stable transgenic rice plants with a high efficiency (up to 100%). Because tRNA and its processing system are virtually conserved in all living organisms, this method could be broadly used to boost the targeting capability and editing efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 toolkits.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Xie","given":"Kabin"},{"family":"Minkenberg","given":"Bastian"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yinong"}],"citation-key":"xie2015","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"PNAS","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1420294112","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,3,17]]},"language":"en","page":"3570-3575","PMID":"25733849","publisher":"National Academy of Sciences","section":"Biological Sciences","source":"www.pnas.org","title":"Boosting CRISPR/Cas9 multiplex editing capability with the endogenous tRNA-processing system","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.pnas.org/content/112/11/3570","volume":"112"},

  {"id":"xu2016","abstract":"Rice (Oryza sativa) provides a staple food source for more than 50% of the world's population. An increase in yield can significantly contribute to global food security. Hybrid breeding can potentially help to meet this goal because hybrid rice often shows a considerable increase in yield when compared with pure-bred cultivars. We recently developed a marker-guided prediction method for hybrid yield and showed a substantial increase in yield through genomic hybrid breeding. We now have transcriptomic and metabolomic data as potential resources for prediction. Using six prediction methods, including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), stochastic search variable selection, partial least squares, and support vector machines using the radial basis function and polynomial kernel function, we found that the predictability of hybrid yield can be further increased using these omic data. LASSO and BLUP are the most efficient methods for yield prediction. For high heritability traits, genomic data remain the most efficient predictors. When metabolomic data are used, the predictability of hybrid yield is almost doubled compared with genomic prediction. Of the 21 945 potential hybrids derived from 210 recombinant inbred lines, selection of the top 10 hybrids predicted from metabolites would lead to a 30% increase in yield. We hypothesize that each metabolite represents a biologically built-in genetic network for yield; thus, using metabolites for prediction is equivalent to using information integrated from these hidden genetic networks for yield prediction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Shizhong"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qifa"}],"citation-key":"xu2016","container-title":"The Plant Journal","DOI":"10.1111/tpj.13242","ISSN":"1365-313X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/tpj.13242","page":"219-227","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Metabolomic prediction of yield in hybrid rice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/tpj.13242","volume":"88"},

  {"id":"xu2021","abstract":"Cell pluripotency is fundamental to biology. It has long been known that differentiated somatic plant cells may reacquire pluripotency, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In many plant species, a single isolated mesophyll protoplast may regenerate into an entire plant, which is widely used in gene transformation. Here, we identified two transcription factors whose ectopic activation promotes protoplast regeneration. Furthermore, we found that their expression was induced by protoplast isolation but at a very low frequency. Using live imaging and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that isolating protoplasts induces enhanced expression variation at the genome level. Isolating protoplasts also leads to genome-wide increases in chromatin accessibility, which promotes stochastic activation of gene expression and enhances protoplast regeneration. We propose that transcriptome chaos with increased expression variability among cells creates a cellular-level evolutionary driver selecting for regenerating cells.\nIsolating protoplasts allows stochastic gene expression to enable regeneration of differentiated cells at a low frequency.\nIsolating protoplasts allows stochastic gene expression to enable regeneration of differentiated cells at a low frequency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Mengxue"},{"family":"Du","given":"Qingwei"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Caihuan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Jiao","given":"Yuling"}],"citation-key":"xu2021","container-title":"Science Advances","DOI":"10.1126/sciadv.abg8466","ISSN":"2375-2548","issue":"33","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"eabg8466","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Article","source":"advances.sciencemag.org","title":"Stochastic gene expression drives mesophyll protoplast regeneration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/33/eabg8466","volume":"7"},

However, these eQTL studies may suffer from low or moderate statistical power and overly conservative false-discovery rate. In practice, most algorithms for eQTL identification do not model the joint effects of multiple genetic variants with weak or moderate influence. Here we present a novel machine-learning algorithm, lasso least-squares kernel machine (LSKM-LASSO) that model the association between multiple genetic variants and phenotypic traits simultaneously with the existence of nongenetic and genetic confounding. With a more general and flexible framework for the estimation of genetic confounding, LSKM-LASSO is able to provide a more accurate evaluation of the joint effects of multiple genetic variants. Our simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of eQTL identification and phenotype prediction. We then apply our method to genotype and gene expression data of 11 tissues obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Our algorithm was able to identify more genes with eQTL than other algorithms. By incorporating a regularization term and combining it with least-squares kernel machine, LSKM-LASSO provides a powerful tool for eQTL mapping and phenotype prediction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Yan","given":"Kang K."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Hongyu"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Joseph T."},{"family":"Pang","given":"Herbert"}],"citation-key":"yan","container-title":"Genetic Epidemiology","DOI":"10.1002/gepi.22341","ISSN":"1098-2272","issue":"n/a","language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/gepi.22341","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"An enhanced machine learning tool for cis-eQTL mapping with regularization and confounder adjustments","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/gepi.22341","volume":"n/a"},

However, genomic variations between cultivars of allotetraploid upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), the most widely planted cotton species in the world, remain unexplored. Here, we use single-molecule long read and Hi-C sequencing technologies to assemble genomes of the two upland cotton cultivars TM-1 and zhongmiansuo24 (ZM24). Comparisons among TM-1 and ZM24 assemblies and the genomes of the diploid ancestors reveal a large amount of genetic variations. Among them, the top three longest structural variations are located on chromosome A08 of the tetraploid upland cotton, which account for ~30% total length of this chromosome. Haplotype analyses of the mapping population derived from these two cultivars and the germplasm panel show suppressed recombination rates in this region. This study provides additional genomic resources for the community, and the identified genetic variations, especially the reduced meiotic recombination on chromosome A08, will help future breeding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhaoen"},{"family":"Ge","given":"Xiaoyang"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zuoren"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Wenqiang"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Gaofei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhi"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ji"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ye"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Lili"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Mo","given":"Huijuan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xueyan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Fuguang"}],"citation-key":"yang2019","container-title":"Nature Communications","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-019-10820-x","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,5]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"2989","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Extensive intraspecific gene order and gene structural variations in upland cotton cultivars","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10820-x","volume":"10"},

Knowledge of this diversity could help in crop improvement; however, gold-standard genomes have been elucidated only for modern temperate varieties. Here, we present a high-quality reference genome (contig N50 of 15.78 megabases) of the maize small-kernel inbred line, which is derived from a tropical landrace. Using haplotype maps derived from B73, Mo17 and SK, we identified 80,614 polymorphic structural variants across 521 diverse lines. Approximately 22% of these variants could not be detected by traditional single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based approaches, and some of them could affect gene expression and trait performance. To illustrate the utility of the diverse SK line, we used it to perform map-based cloning of a major effect quantitative trait locus controlling kernel weight—a key trait selected during maize improvement.

Here, we use large-scale genome-wide association study summary data to investigate the shared genetic architecture between MS and IBD overall and UC and CD independently. We find a significantly greater genetic correlation between MS and UC than between MS and CD, and identify three SNPs shared between MS and IBD (rs13428812), UC (rs116555563) and CD (rs13428812, rs9977672) in cross-trait meta-analyses. We find suggestive evidence for a causal effect of MS on UC and IBD using Mendelian randomization, but no or weak and inconsistent evidence for a causal effect of IBD or UC on MS. We observe largely consistent patterns of tissue-specific heritability enrichment for MS and IBDs in lung, spleen, whole blood and small intestine, and identify cell-type-specific enrichment for MS and IBDs in CD4+ T cells in lung and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in lung and spleen.

  {"id":"yin2017","abstract":"Space calling Earth, on the quantum line\nA successful quantum communication network will rely on the ability to distribute entangled photons over large distances between receiver stations. So far, free-space demonstrations have been limited to line-of-sight links across cities or between mountaintops. Scattering and coherence decay have limited the link separations to around 100 km. Yin et al. used the Micius satellite, which was launched last year and is equipped with a specialized quantum optical payload. They successfully demonstrated the satellite-based entanglement distribution to receiver stations separated by more than 1200 km. The results illustrate the possibility of a future global quantum communication network.\nScience, this issue p. 1140\nLong-distance entanglement distribution is essential for both foundational tests of quantum physics and scalable quantum networks. Owing to channel loss, however, the previously achieved distance was limited to ~100 kilometers. Here we demonstrate satellite-based distribution of entangled photon pairs to two locations separated by 1203 kilometers on Earth, through two satellite-to-ground downlinks with a summed length varying from 1600 to 2400 kilometers. We observed a survival of two-photon entanglement and a violation of Bell inequality by 2.37 ± 0.09 under strict Einstein locality conditions. The obtained effective link efficiency is orders of magnitude higher than that of the direct bidirectional transmission of the two photons through telecommunication fibers.\nEntangled photons are distributed over vast distances using a satellite-to-ground link.\nEntangled photons are distributed over vast distances using a satellite-to-ground link.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Yin","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yu-Huai"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Sheng-Kai"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Liang"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Ji-Gang"},{"family":"Cai","given":"Wen-Qi"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wei-Yue"},{"family":"Li","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Hui"},{"family":"Li","given":"Guang-Bing"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Qi-Ming"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Yun-Hong"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shuang-Lin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Feng-Zhi"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Ya-Yun"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Zi-Qing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Ming"},{"family":"Jia","given":"Jian-Jun"},{"family":"Ren","given":"Ge"},{"family":"He","given":"Dong"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Yi-Lin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiao-Xiang"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Na"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Xiang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Zhen-Cai"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Nai-Le"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yu-Ao"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Chao-Yang"},{"family":"Shu","given":"Rong"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Cheng-Zhi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jian-Yu"},{"family":"Pan","given":"Jian-Wei"}],"citation-key":"yin2017","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aan3211","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6343","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,6,16]]},"language":"en","page":"1140-1144","PMID":"28619937","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Articles","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Satellite-based entanglement distribution over 1200 kilometers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6343/1140","volume":"356"},

  {"id":"yoo2014","abstract":"The single-celled cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fiber provides an excellent model to investigate how human selection affects phenotypic evolution. To gain insight into the evolutionary genomics of cotton domestication, we conducted comparative transcriptome profiling of developing cotton fibers using RNA-Seq. Analysis of single-celled fiber transcriptomes from four wild and five domesticated accessions from two developmental time points revealed that at least one-third and likely one-half of the genes in the genome are expressed at any one stage during cotton fiber development. Among these, ∼5,000 genes are differentially expressed during primary and secondary cell wall synthesis between wild and domesticated cottons, with a biased distribution among chromosomes. Transcriptome data implicate a number of biological processes affected by human selection, and suggest that the domestication process has prolonged the duration of fiber elongation in modern cultivated forms. Functional analysis suggested that wild cottons allocate greater resources to stress response pathways, while domestication led to reprogrammed resource allocation toward increased fiber growth, possibly through modulating stress-response networks. This first global transcriptomic analysis using multiple accessions of wild and domesticated cottons is an important step toward a more comprehensive systems perspective on cotton fiber evolution. The understanding that human selection over the past 5,000+ years has dramatically re-wired the cotton fiber transcriptome sets the stage for a deeper understanding of the genetic architecture underlying cotton fiber synthesis and phenotypic evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Yoo","given":"Mi-Jeong"},{"family":"Wendel","given":"Jonathan F."}],"citation-key":"yoo2014","container-title":"PLOS Genetics","container-title-short":"PLOS Genetics","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pgen.1004073","ISSN":"1553-7404","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"e1004073","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Comparative Evolutionary and Developmental Dynamics of the Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) Fiber Transcriptome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004073","volume":"10"},

This sequencing of cell free RNA constitutes a background contamination that has the potential to confound the correct biological interpretation of single cell transcriptomic data. Here, we demonstrate that contamination from this \"soup\" of cell free RNAs is ubiquitous, experiment specific in its composition and magnitude, and can lead to erroneous biological conclusions. We present a method, SoupX, for quantifying the extent of the contamination and estimating \"background corrected\", cell expression profiles that can be integrated with existing downstream analysis tools.

  {"id":"yu2019","abstract":"Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) fibres consist of single cells that grow in a highly polarized manner, assumed to be controlled by the cytoskeleton1–3. However, how the cytoskeletal organization and dynamics underpin fibre development remains unexplored. Moreover, it is unclear whether cotton fibres expand via tip growth or diffuse growth2–4. We generated stable transgenic cotton plants expressing fluorescent markers of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. Live-cell imaging revealed that elongating cotton fibres assemble a cortical filamentous actin network that extends along the cell axis to finally form actin strands with closed loops in the tapered fibre tip. Analyses of F-actin network properties indicate that cotton fibres have a unique actin organization that blends features of both diffuse and tip growth modes. Interestingly, typical actin organization and endosomal vesicle aggregation found in tip-growing cell apices were not observed in fibre tips.

  {"id":"yu2021","abstract":"Cultivated rice varieties are all diploid, and polyploidization of rice has long been desired because of its advantages in genome buffering, vigorousness, and environmental robustness. However, a workable route remains elusive. Here, we describe a practical strategy, namely de novo domestication of wild allotetraploid rice. By screening allotetraploid wild rice inventory, we identiﬁed one genotype of Oryza alta (CCDD), polyploid rice 1 (PPR1), and established two important resources for its de novo domestication: (1) an efﬁcient tissue culture, transformation, and genome editing system and (2) a high-quality genome assembly discriminated into two subgenomes of 12 chromosomes apiece. With these resources, we show that six agronomically important traits could be rapidly improved by editing O. alta homologs of the genes controlling these traits in diploid rice. Our results demonstrate the possibility that de novo domesticated allotetraploid rice can be developed into a new staple cereal to strengthen world food security.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Meng","given":"Xiangbing"},{"family":"Du","given":"Huilong"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jingkun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Guifu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Mingjiang"},{"family":"Jing","given":"Yanhui"},{"family":"Kou","given":"Liquan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiuxiu"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiangdong"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Zhilan"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Yuntao"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Zhukuan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Mingsheng"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Zhixi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yonghong"},{"family":"Chu","given":"Chengcai"},{"family":"Zuo","given":"Jianru"},{"family":"Wan","given":"Jianmin"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Han","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Zuccolo","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Wing","given":"Rod A."},{"family":"Gao","given":"Caixia"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Chengzhi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jiayang"}],"citation-key":"yu2021","container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2021.01.013","ISSN":"00928674","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","page":"S0092867421000131","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A route to de novo domestication of wild allotetraploid rice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867421000131"},

  {"id":"zan2016","abstract":"Abstract\n            An increased knowledge of the genetic regulation of expression in Arabidopsis thaliana is likely to provide important insights about the basis of the plant’s extensive phenotypic variation. Here, we reanalyzed two publicly available datasets with genome-wide data on genetic and transcript variation in large collections of natural A. thaliana accessions. Transcripts from more than half of all genes were detected in the leaves of all accessions, and from nearly all annotated genes in at least one accession. Thousands of genes had high transcript levels in some accessions, but no transcripts at all in others, and this pattern was correlated with the genome-wide genotype. In total, 2669 eQTL were mapped in the largest population, and 717 of them were replicated in the other population. A total of 646 cis-eQTL-regulated genes that lacked detectable transcripts in some accessions was found, and for 159 of these we identified one, or several, common structural variants in the populations that were shown to be likely contributors to the lack of detectable RNA transcripts for these genes. This study thus provides new insights into the overall genetic regulation of global gene expression diversity in the leaf of natural A. thaliana accessions. Further, it also shows that strong cis-acting polymorphisms, many of which are likely to be structural variations, make important contributions to the transcriptional variation in the worldwide A. thaliana population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Zan","given":"Yanjun"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Xia"},{"family":"Forsberg","given":"Simon K G"},{"family":"Carlborg","given":"Örjan"}],"citation-key":"zan2016","container-title":"G3 Genes|Genomes|Genetics","DOI":"10.1534/g3.116.030874","ISSN":"2160-1836","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2319-2328","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Genetic Regulation of Transcriptional Variation in Natural Arabidopsis thaliana Accessions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/6/8/2319/6054882","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"zeng1994","abstract":"Adequate separation of effects of possible multiple linked quantitative trait loci (QTLs) on mapping QTLs is the key to increasing the precision of QTL mapping. A new method of QTL mapping is proposed and analyzed in this paper by combining interval mapping with multiple regression. The basis of the proposed method is an interval test in which the test statistic on a marker interval is made to be unaffected by QTLs located outside a defined interval. This is achieved by fitting other genetic markers in the statistical model as a control when performing interval mapping. Compared with the current QTL mapping method (i.e., the interval mapping method which uses a pair or two pairs of markers for mapping QTLs), this method has several advantages. (1) By confining the test to one region at a time, it reduces a multiple dimensional search problem (for multiple QTLs) to a one dimensional search problem. (2) By conditioning linked markers in the test, the sensitivity of the test statistic to the position of individual QTLs is increased, and the precision of QTL mapping can be improved. (3) By selectively and simultaneously using other markers in the analysis, the efficiency of QTL mapping can be also improved. The behavior of the test statistic under the null hypothesis and appropriate critical value of the test statistic for an overall test in a genome are discussed and analyzed. A simulation study of QTL mapping is also presented which illustrates the utility, properties, advantages and disadvantages of the method.","author":[{"family":"Zeng","given":"Z.

We detect significant (P < 0.05/28) signatures of natural selection in the genetic architecture of 23 traits, including reproductive, cardiovascular, and anthropometric traits, as well as educational attainment. The significant estimates of the relationship between effect size and minor allele frequency in complex traits are consistent with a model of negative (or purifying) selection, as confirmed by forward simulation.

  {"id":"zhang","abstract":"Lettuce (Lactuca sativa) is one of the most important vegetable crops in the world. As a leafy vegetable, the polymorphism of lettuce leaves from dark to pale green is an important trait. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying such variations remain poorly understood. In this study, one major locus controlling the polymorphism of dark- and pale-green leaves in lettuce was identified using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This locus was then fine mapped to an interval of 5375 bp on chromosome 4 using a segregating population containing 2480 progeny. Only one gene, homologous to the GLK genes in Arabidopsis and other plants, is present in the candidate region. A complementation test confirmed that the candidate gene, LsGLK, contributes to the variation of dark- and pale-green leaves. Sequence analysis showed that a CACTA transposon of 7434 bp was inserted 10 bp downstream of the stop codon of LsGLK, followed by a duplication of a 1826-bp fragment covering exons 3–6 of the LsGLK gene. The transposon insertion did not change the expression level of the LsGLK gene. However, because of alternative splicing, only 6% of the transcripts produced from the transposon insertion were wild-type transcripts, which led to the production of pale-green leaves.

Although a significant genotype × test interaction was detected for DSR, 37 MAGIC lines were consistently resistant to VW. Of 13 and 12 VW resistance QTL declared in Test 1 and 2, respectively, through a genome-wide association study (GWAS), three QTL on chromosome A01, D02 and D08 were in common and three QTL clusters were detected on chromosome A01, A13, and D01 between the two tests. The narrow chromosomal regions for the three common resistance QTL allowed identification of possible candidate genes for VW resistance.

  {"id":"zhang2019b","abstract":"Construction of chromosome-level assembly is a vital step in achieving the goal of a ‘Platinum’ genome, but it remains a major challenge to assemble and anchor sequences to chromosomes in autopolyploid or highly heterozygous genomes. High-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technology serves as a robust tool to dramatically advance chromosome scaffolding; however, existing approaches are mostly designed for diploid genomes and often with the aim of reconstructing a haploid representation, thereby having limited power to reconstruct chromosomes for autopolyploid genomes. We developed a novel algorithm (ALLHiC) that is capable of building allele-aware, chromosomal-scale assembly for autopolyploid genomes using Hi-C paired-end reads with innovative ‘prune’ and ‘optimize’ steps. Application on simulated data showed that ALLHiC can phase allelic contigs and substantially improve ordering and orientation when compared to other mainstream Hi-C assemblers. We applied ALLHiC on an autotetraploid and an autooctoploid sugar-cane genome and successfully constructed the phased chromosomal-level assemblies, revealing allelic variations present in these two genomes. The ALLHiC pipeline enables de novo chromosome-level assembly of autopolyploid genomes, separating each allele. Haplotype chromosome-level assembly of allopolyploid and heterozygous diploid genomes can be achieved using ALLHiC, overcoming obstacles in assembling complex genomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xingtan"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shengcheng"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Ming","given":"Ray"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Haibao"}],"citation-key":"zhang2019b","container-title":"Nature Plants","container-title-short":"Nat.

The deleterious mutations in potato are enriched in the pericentromeric regions and are line specific. Using three F2 populations, we identified 15 genomic regions with severe segregation distortions due to selection at the gametic and zygotic stages.

The comprehensive analysis identified a total of 724,438 high-confidence single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 26,026 expressed genes.

Two distant eQTL hotspots were found with target genes significantly enriched in specific functional classifications.

  {"id":"zhang2020a","abstract":"Flowering plants, or angiosperms, consist of more than 300,000 species, far more than any other land plant lineages. The accumulated evidence indicates that multiple ancient polyploidy events occurred around 100 to 120 million years ago during the Cretaceous and drove the early diversification of four major clades of angiosperms: gamma whole-genome triplication in the common ancestor of core eudicots, tau whole-genome duplication during the early diversification of monocots, lambda whole-genome duplication during the early diversification of magnoliids, and pi whole-genome duplication in the Nymphaeales lineage. These four polyploidy events have played essential roles in the adaptive evolution and diversification of major clades of flowering plants. Here, we specifically review the current understanding of this wave of ancient whole-genome duplications and their evolutionary significance. Notably, although these ancient whole-genome duplications occurred independently, they have contributed to the expansion of many stress-related genes (e.g., heat shock transcription factors and Arabidopsis response regulators)，and these genes could have been selected for by global environmental changes in the Cretaceous. Therefore, this ancient wave of paleopolyploidy events could have significantly contributed to the adaptation of angiosperms to environmental changes, and potentially promoted the wide diversification of flowering plants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Liangsheng"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shengdan"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Xiaojun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiuyun"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yunpeng"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Yiping"},{"family":"Trigiano","given":"Robert N."},{"family":"Jiao","given":"Yuannian"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Fei"}],"citation-key":"zhang2020a","container-title":"Plant, Cell & Environment","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pce.13898","ISSN":"1365-3040","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/pce.13898","page":"2847-2856","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The ancient wave of polyploidization events in flowering plants and their facilitated adaptation to environmental stress","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pce.13898","volume":"43"},

Here we report the assembly of a high-quality chromosome-scale reference genome for an ancient tea tree. The further RNA sequencing of 217 diverse tea accessions clarifies the pedigree of tea cultivars and reveals key contributors in the breeding of Chinese tea. Candidate genes associated with flavonoid biosynthesis are identified by genome-wide association study. Specifically, diverse allelic function of CsANR, CsF3’5’H and CsMYB5 is verified by transient overexpression and enzymatic assays, providing comprehensive insights into the biosynthesis of catechins, the most important bioactive compounds in tea plants. The inconspicuous differentiation between ancient trees and cultivars at both genetic and metabolic levels implies that tea may not have undergone long-term artificial directional selection in terms of flavor-related metabolites. These genomic resources provide evolutionary insight into tea plants and lay the foundation for better understanding the biosynthesis of beneficial natural compounds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Weiyi"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Youjun"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Haiji"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yafei"},{"family":"Wan","given":"Haoliang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiaoliang"},{"family":"Scossa","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Alseekh","given":"Saleh"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Qinghua"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Pu"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Li"},{"family":"Schmidt","given":"Maximilian H.-W."},{"family":"Jia","given":"Xinxin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Daili"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Anting"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Fei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Ni","given":"Dejiang"},{"family":"Usadel","given":"Björn"},{"family":"Fernie","given":"Alisdair R."},{"family":"Wen","given":"Weiwei"}],"citation-key":"zhang2020c","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-020-17498-6","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,24]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Agricultural genetics;Genetic variation;Genome evolution;Natural variation in plants\nSubject_term_id: agricultural-genetics;genetic-variation;genome-evolution;natural-variation-in-plants","number":"1","page":"3719","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Genome assembly of wild tea tree DASZ reveals pedigree and selection history of tea varieties","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17498-6","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"zhang2021","abstract":"Computational analysis of cell walls\nLayers of intertwined fibers make up plant cell walls. The various types of fibers respond differently to deformation. Cellulose microfibrils, for example, can stretch or curve, changing their end-to-end length, and can also slide past each other, reorient relative directions, and bundle with neighboring microfibrils. Zhang et al. developed a computational model based on observations of onion skin epidermis that describes how these complex changes in space govern cell wall mechanics. The results inform ways to engineer multifunctional fibrous materials.\nScience, this issue p. 706\nPlants have evolved complex nanofibril-based cell walls to meet diverse biological and physical constraints. How strength and extensibility emerge from the nanoscale-to-mesoscale organization of growing cell walls has long been unresolved. We sought to clarify the mechanical roles of cellulose and matrix polysaccharides by developing a coarse-grained model based on polymer physics that recapitulates aspects of assembly and tensile mechanics of epidermal cell walls. Simple noncovalent binding interactions in the model generate bundled cellulose networks resembling that of primary cell walls and possessing stress-dependent elasticity, stiffening, and plasticity beyond a yield threshold. Plasticity originates from fibril-fibril sliding in aligned cellulose networks. This physical model provides quantitative insight into fundamental questions of plant mechanobiology and reveals design principles of biomaterials that combine stiffness with yielding and extensibility.\nA physical model connects microstructure and microfibril motions to complex stress-strain behaviors of extensible plant cell walls.\nA physical model connects microstructure and microfibril motions to complex stress-strain behaviors of extensible plant cell walls.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yao"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Jingyi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xuan"},{"family":"Durachko","given":"Daniel M."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Sulin"},{"family":"Cosgrove","given":"Daniel J."}],"citation-key":"zhang2021","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.abf2824","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6543","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,14]]},"language":"en","page":"706-711","PMID":"33986175","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","section":"Research Article","source":"science.sciencemag.org","title":"Molecular insights into the complex mechanics of plant epidermal cell walls","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6543/706","volume":"372"},

Analysis of allele-specific expression suggests a potential mechanism in response to mutation load during long-term clonal propagation. Population genomic analysis using 190 Camellia accessions uncovered independent evolutionary histories and parallel domestication in two widely cultivated varieties, var. sinensis and var. assamica. It also revealed extensive intra- and interspecific introgressions contributing to genetic diversity in modern cultivars. Strong signatures of selection were associated with biosynthetic and metabolic pathways that contribute to flavor characteristics as well as genes likely involved in the Green Revolution in the tea industry.

Here, we introduce RapMap, a method for rapid multi-QTL mapping by employing F2 gradient populations (F2GPs) constructed by minor-phenotypic-difference accessions. The co-segregation standard of the single-locus genetic models ensures simultaneous integration of a three-in-one framework in RapMap i.e. detecting a real QTL, confirming its effect, and obtaining its near-isogenic line-like line (NIL-LL). We demonstrate the feasibility of RapMap by cloning eight rice grain-size genes using 15 F2GPs in three years. These genes explain a total of 75% of grain shape variation. Allele frequency analysis of these genes using a large germplasm collection reveals directional selection of the slender and long grains in indica rice domestication. In addition, major grain-size genes have been strongly selected during rice domestication.

The chromatin architecture is separated into different independent spatial interacting modules with distinct transcriptional potential and covers approximately 82% of the genome. Compared to inactive modules, active modules possess the majority of active loop genes with higher density and contribute to most of the transcriptional activity in rice. In addition, promoter–promoter interacting genes tend to be transcribed cooperatively. In contrast, the heterochromatin-mediated loops form relative stable structure domains in chromatin configuration. Furthermore, we examine the impact of genetic variation on chromatin interactions and transcription and identify a spatial correlation between the genetic regulation of eQTLs and e-traits.

Previous studies in rice (Oryza sativa) have focused mainly on the identification of GVs, whereas systematic functional annotation of GVs has not yet been performed. Here, we present a functional impact map of GVs in rice. We curated haplotype information for 17 397 026 GVs from sequencing data of 4726 rice accessions. We quantitatively evaluated the effects of missense mutations in coding regions in each haplotype based on the conservation of amino acid residues and obtained the effects of 918 848 non-redundant missense GVs. Furthermore, we generated high-quality chromatin accessibility (CA) data from six representative rice tissues and used these data to train deep convolutional neural network models to predict the impacts of 5 067 405 GVs for CA in regulatory regions. We characterized the functional properties and tissue specificity of the GV effects and found that large-effect GVs in coding and regulatory regions may be subject to selection in different directions. Finally, we demonstrated how the functional impact map could be used to prioritize causal variants in mapping populations.

Efforts are underway to transform the crop from a clonally propagated tetraploid into a seed-propagated, inbred-line-based hybrid, but this process requires a better understanding of potato genome. Here, we report the 1.67-Gb haplotype-resolved assembly of a diploid potato, RH89-039-16, using a combination of multiple sequencing strategies, including circular consensus sequencing. Comparison of the two haplotypes revealed ~2.1% intragenomic diversity, including 22,134 predicted deleterious mutations in 10,642 annotated genes. In 20,583 pairs of allelic genes, 16.6% and 30.8% exhibited differential expression and methylation between alleles, respectively. Deleterious mutations and differentially expressed alleles were dispersed throughout both haplotypes, complicating strategies to eradicate deleterious alleles or stack beneficial alleles via meiotic recombination. This study offers a holistic view of the genome organization of a clonally propagated diploid species and provides insights into technological evolution in resolving complex genomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Dié"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Wu"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhongmin"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Hamilton","given":"John P."},{"family":"Visser","given":"Richard G.

  {"id":"zhu2018","abstract":"Humans heavily rely on dozens of domesticated plant species that have been further improved through intensive breeding. To evaluate how breeding changed the tomato fruit metabolome, we have generated and analyzed a dataset encompassing genomes, transcriptomes, and metabolomes from hundreds of tomato genotypes. The combined results illustrate how breeding globally altered fruit metabolite content. Selection for alleles of genes associated with larger fruits altered metabolite proﬁles as a consequence of linkage with nearby genes. Selection of ﬁve major loci reduced the accumulation of anti-nutritional steroidal glycoalkaloids in ripened fruits, rendering the fruit more edible. Breeding for pink tomatoes modiﬁed the content of over 100 metabolites. The introgression of resistance genes from wild relatives in cultivars also resulted in major and unexpected metabolic changes. The study reveals a multi-omics view of the metabolic breeding history of tomato, as well as provides insights into metabolome-assisted breeding and plant biology.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Guangtao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Shouchuang"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Zejun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Shuaibin"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Qinggang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Chunzhi"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Qin","given":"Mao"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Chenkun"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Xue"},{"family":"Han","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaoxuan"},{"family":"Knaap","given":"Esther","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhonghua"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Xia"},{"family":"Klee","given":"Harry"},{"family":"Fernie","given":"Alisdair R."},{"family":"Luo","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Sanwen"}],"citation-key":"zhu2018","container-title":"Cell","container-title-short":"Cell","DOI":"10.1016/j.cell.2017.12.019","event-place":"Cambridge","ISSN":"00928674","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1]]},"language":"en","page":"249-261.e12","publisher":"Cell Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rewiring of the Fruit Metabolome in Tomato Breeding","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S009286741731499X","volume":"172"},

Since in general external annotations alone have limited accuracy in predicting functional effects, a simple filter based on such annotations (as commonly performed in \n    many RV association analysis) may result in both false positive and negatives.

The parameter estimates will only differ if the variables are correlated and the sets of variables that are included in the models differ. \n\nRegarding the tests of the coefficients, it depends on which function you use to get your output. You used summary(). What is reported then are the 𝑡-tests associated with the parameter estimates. Those are not computed by partitioning sums of squares. However, they are equivalent to 𝐹-tests using type III SS. The order variables are listed in doesn't matter for 𝑡-tests or 𝐹-tests that are based on type III SS. You can also use anova() to get significance tests of your parameter estimates. That is where R uses type I SS. And because type I SS are sequential, the order the variables are listed in does matter (although again, only if the variables are correlated).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,7]]},"citation-key":"zotero-6412","title":"Controlling covariates in linear regression in R - Cross Validated","type":"webpage","URL":"https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/89032/controlling-covariates-in-linear-regression-in-r"},
