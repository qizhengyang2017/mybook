### Abstract
_Trans_-eQTL exerted their effects via several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by transcription factors.


==他用到的表型有1200多种==

 Expression of 13% of the genes correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes, pinpointing potential drivers for those traits.

 ### Main
Trans-eQTL, for which the SNP is located distal to the gene (>5 Mb) or on another chromosome, usually have smaller effect sizes than cis-eQTL and thus require larger sample sizes for detection. 

However, trans-eQTL could be relevant for complex traits because, compared to stronger cis-eQTL effects, ==each individual trans effect is less likely to be dampened by compensatory post-transcriptional buffering or removed from the population by negative selection2,3==（疑惑）. Indeed, genes regulated by weak eQTL effects are estimated to have more impact on the phenotype as compared to those regulated by strong eQTL effects1. Individual trans-eQTL SNPs can affect many genes and have a widespread impact on regulatory networks. ==Consequently, weak trans-eQTL have the potential to identify trait-relevant genes== （列举了七篇文献） and have already been used to prioritize genes that are likely to contribute to disease.

反式eQTL很重要


While trans-eQTL are useful for the identification of distal effects of a single variant, a different approach is required to determine the combined consequences of all variants associated with a polygenic trait. Polygenic scores (PGSs) summarize genome-wide combined risk for a complex disease into a single metric that may be used to stratify individuals into groups11,12. 为什么要给个体分组呢？




The recently proposed omnigenic model13,14 postulates that the heritability of most complex traits is dominated by numerous weak trans effects and hypothesizes that those effects converge on a smaller set of trait-relevant ‘core’ genes. 

最近提出的全基因模型 13, 14 假设大多数复杂性状的遗传力受众多弱反式效应的支配，并假设这些效应集中在一组较小的与性状相关的“核心”基因上。

==This suggests that associations between PGSs and gene expression (expression quantitative trait scores, eQTSs) could help to prioritize putative trait-relevant genes ==(Supplementary Note and Liu et al.14). 

疑惑：基因表达量 == expression quantitative trait scores


While it remains unclear what fraction of the genome affects complex traits, we here systematically investigated trans-eQTL and eQTS to determine how genetic effects regulate genes and pathways and whether these effects could be informative about the biology of the respective traits.



















### 概念

polygenic scores  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygenic_score
In genetics, a polygenic score (PGS), also called a polygenic risk score (PRS), genetic risk score, or genome-wide score, is a number that summarises the estimated effect of many genetic variants on an individual's phenotype, ==typically calculated as a weighted sum of trait-associated alleles==.[1][2][3] It reflects an individual's estimated genetic predisposition for a given trait and can be used as a predictor for that trait.[4][5][6][7][8] In other words, it gives an estimate of how likely an individual is to have a given trait only based on genetics, without taking environmental factors into account. Polygenic scores are widely used in animal breeding and plant breeding (usually termed genomic prediction or genomic selection) due to their efficacy in improving livestock breeding and crops.[9] In humans, polygenic scores are typically generated from genome-wide association study (GWAS) data.
