> "Identifying natural allelic variation that underlies quantitative trait variation remains a fundamental problem in genetics. Most studies have employed either simple synthetic populations with or performed association mapping on a sample of naturally occurring haplotypes. Both of these approaches have some limitations, therefore alternative resources for the genetic dissection of complex traits continue to be sought." ([Kover 2009:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G83EU4ZX?page=1))

> "Here, we present the first panel of MAGIC lines developed: a set of 527 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) descended from a heterogeneous stock of 19 intermated accessions of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana." ([Kover 2009:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G83EU4ZX?page=1))

> "A related strategy, that avoids the need to re-genotype, is to generate RILs from multiple parents [32,33], where the genomes of the founders are first mixed by several rounds of mating and then inbred to generate a stable panel of inbred lines. The name MAGIC (for multiparent advanced" ([Kover 2009:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G83EU4ZX?page=2))

> "generation intercross) has been suggested for this type of population [33]" ([Kover 2009:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G83EU4ZX?page=2))

> "The larger number of accumulated recombination events increase the mapping accuracy of the detected QTL compared to an F2 cross" ([Kover 2009:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G83EU4ZX?page=2))

> "We describe their construction and genomic structure, and demonstrate that these lines can be used for QTL fine-mapping using examples of developmental traits. Finally, we establish the statistical and computational tools and resources required for their analysis, and propose new candidate genes for germination date and bolting time." ([Kover 2009:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G83EU4ZX?page=2))

> "The sources of the missing heritability might include environmental interactions, undetected QTL with small genetic effects, and epistasis. Dominance effects should be negligible given the lines are effectively inbred." ([Kover 2009:8](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G83EU4ZX?page=8))

> "A hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to make a multipoint probabilistic reconstruction of the genome of each ML as a mosaic of the founder haplotypes [37]." ([Kover 2009:12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G83EU4ZX?page=12))
