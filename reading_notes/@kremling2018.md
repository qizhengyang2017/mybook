> "we characterize the effect of rare alleles and evolutionary history on the regulation of expression. Rare alleles are associated with the dysregulation of expression, and we correlate this dysregulation to seed-weight fitness." ([Kremling 2018:520](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FHKC32E7?page=1))

> "Additionally, the rapid linkage disequilibrium decay in maize enables the testing of whether rare alleles or novel combinations of common alleles drive extreme expression." ([Kremling 2018:520](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FHKC32E7?page=1))

> "We further used the variance explained to quantify whether alleles that were rare in prebottleneck tropical lines22 have a disproportionately large role in the regulation of expression in modern temperate bottlenecked germplasm (see Methods)." ([Kremling 2018:520](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/FHKC32E7?page=1))

> "To determine whether rare alleles contribute to extreme gene expression, we investigated whether rare-allele abundance is greatest in individuals with extreme gene expression. We calculated an expression rank and upstream (5 kb) rare-allele count for each combination of gene and individual maize line10 (Fig. 1a). In each tissue, this was done separately for each of the 5,000 most highly expressed genes. At each expression rank we plotted the mean number of rare alleles across the 5,000 gene-line combinations, which gave a mean number of rare cis variants at each rank. If rare alleles drive extreme expression, then individuals at the lowest and highest expression ranks should have the highest number of rare cis variants."

> "Although the quadratic regression is highly significant, even more-extreme departures exist at the tails than predicted by the regression (Fig. 1b, c); we therefore focus on the rare-allele count deviations of the five highest- and lowest-expressing individuals across the 5,000 most-expressed genes. Across the tissues, individuals that express at the lowest five expression ranks are enriched 1.68–1.86-fold for local rare alleles compared to the middle two quartiles, whereas the top five ranks are enriched by 1.22–1.46-fold over the middle two quartiles (Fig. 1b, e and Extended Data Fig. 2)."

-   尽管二次回归非常显着，但尾部存在比回归预测的更极端的偏离（图 1b、c）；
-   因此，我们关注 5,000 个表达最多的基因中五个表达最高和最低的个体的罕见等位基因计数偏差。
-   在整个组织中，与中间两个四分位数相比，在最低五个表达等级表达的个体的局部稀有等位基因富集了 1.68-1.86 倍，而前五个等级比中间两个四分位数富集了 1.22-1.46 倍（

> "Although both overand underexpression are potentially deleterious consequences of dysregulation, we note that there are significantly more cis rare alleles in underexpressing individuals than there are near the same genes in overexpressing individuals (P = 7.91 × 10−32, Fig. 1e). This observation is consistent with stronger selection against underexpression, and with the expression dosage model of fitness and heterosis23."
